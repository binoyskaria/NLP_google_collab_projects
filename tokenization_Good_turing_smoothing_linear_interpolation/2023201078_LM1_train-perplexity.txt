 chapter <initial> it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife 	6.367971833818206

 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters 	4.830477293063864

 my dear <title> bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last 	3.6970359138277753

 <title> bennet replied that he had not 	7.853043534412732

 but it is returned she 	10.375075238083705

 for <title> long has just been here and she told me all about it 	5.511677850942198

 <title> bennet made no answer 	6.625142114702838

 do not you want to know who has taken it 	9.809065226225716

 cried his wife impatiently 	25.335122019059334

 you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it 	7.370096874319589

 this was invitation enough 	9.783572098191796

 why my dear you must know <title> long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england 	4.1062563598053226

 that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with <title> morris immediately 	5.418127165615708

 that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 	7.226040263059416

 what is his name 	18.156286723734887

 is he married or single 	7.728044292880151

 oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune 	6.012851735525953

 four or five thousand a year 	5.023901021739619

 what a fine thing for our girls how so 	4.471057972544973

 how can it affect them 	10.284142509234872

 my dear <title> bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them 	5.563421980736112

 is that his design in settling here 	10.797346499286881

 design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 	5.528770966996001

 i see no occasion for that 	7.056107893333306

 you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them <title> bingley might like you the best of the party 	5.151531901265175

 my dear you flatter me 	7.181271165344468

 when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 	5.336622629097672

 in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of 	4.999052157823109

 but my dear you must indeed go and see <title> bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 	6.699368968757141

 it is more than i engage for i assure you 	7.229135888005039

 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them 	5.682502036754525

 sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers 	4.0574600062472514

 indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not 	4.561723843437345

 you are over scrupulous surely 	7.461055610954584

 i dare say <title> bingley will be very glad to see you 	6.42038713257144

 and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls 	5.722096591522297

 though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy 	10.540944708073557

 i desire you will do no such thing 	7.2949985512490985

 lizzy is not a bit better than the others 	8.33599745314977

 and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia 	4.586605847438358

 but you are always giving her the preference 	8.625386432030114

 they are all silly and ignorant like other girls 	3.3316701150719905

 but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 	4.205454003151211

 <title> bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way 	4.585109394236393

 you have no compassion on my poor nerves 	7.183012048316464

 you mistake me my dear 	6.732450349638725

 i have a high respect for your nerves 	8.270365235486707

 i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least 	3.110383733264259

 depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all 	5.971002000839411

 <title> bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character 	2.968720103495457

 her mind was less difficult to develope 	7.179052202664862

 she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper 	4.143720083975905

 when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous 	6.615847753269972

 the business of her life was to get her daughters married 	10.978437303229176

 its solace was visiting and news 	4.37709458409622

 chapter ii 	44.72575127815273

 he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go 	6.350509580360153

 and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it 	5.908717951758244

 it was then disclosed in the following manner 	9.683111307509954

 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope <title> bingley will like it lizzy 	3.9463347359468046

 we are not in a way to know what <title> bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit 	9.825327174991424

 but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that <title> long has promised to introduce him 	6.908910105786642

 i do not believe <title> long will do any such thing 	5.369958981321336

 she has two nieces of her own 	6.6807569791875965

 she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her 	5.891508015002237

 no more have i said <title> bennet 	9.057272237629414

 and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 	9.48821872977489

 <title> bennet deigned not to make any reply 	8.236099523745656

 but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters 	5.0061925375165925

 do not keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves 	3.9197762924021085

 you tear them to pieces 	13.768819790664365

 she times them ill 	10.287385979696008

 when is your next ball to be lizzy 	9.718250808267696

 to morrow fortnight 	44.17183684483181

 aye so it is cried her mother and <title> long does not come back till the day before 	7.058117546997159

 so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself 	9.413070823984325

 impossible <title> bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself 	11.605073723666711

 how can you be so teazing 	7.285990108763297

 i honour your circumspection 	10.693796349575361

 a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little 	6.565220129674046

 but if we do not venture somebody else will 	6.285318063064498

 and after all <title> long and her nieces must stand their chance 	4.939999698304211

 and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself 	5.248383113319231

 the girls stared at their father 	9.1247598646039

 cried he 	46.97451707519927

 do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense 	4.845549358334386

 for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts 	4.243656744843591

 mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how 	5.177703753964751

 while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to <title> bingley 	3.9563547585427727

 i am sick of <title> bingley cried his wife 	6.821270525178898

 i am sorry to hear that  	7.037996859768723

 but why did not you tell me so before 	8.835421958786528

 it is very unlucky 	9.798291770112783

 but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now 	5.306829059594434

 the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished 	9.567719123984732

 that of <title> bennet perhaps surpassing the rest 	11.904454068795264

 though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while 	6.758652321128578

 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance 	3.889043088073356

 well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now 	4.794247640580241

 now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said <title> bennet 	4.059648429066913

 and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife 	6.31299213109534

 what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut 	6.420409583158817

 i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness 	5.914640170331762

 at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day 	5.866372912346348

 but for your sakes we would do any thing 	5.29405176981046

 lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say <title> bingley will dance with you at the next ball 	6.639795448165284

 oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid 	5.822192752138628

 the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return <title> bennet s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner 	3.9584479699493658

 not all that <title> bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of <title> bingley 	5.500787393628627

 they attacked him in various ways 	9.031175890148983

 with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises 	3.087900099311258

 but he eluded the skill of them all 	4.608780438940025

 and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas 	5.130988428437418

 her report was highly favourable 	6.928783790104156

 sir william had been delighted with him 	12.307409914729437

 he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 	5.241186470358533

 and very lively hopes of <title> bingley s heart were entertained 	6.540869930328758

 if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said <title> bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for 	5.139453771066159

 in a few days <title> bingley returned <title> bennet s visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library 	5.199290402759274

 he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much 	5.9327658651339785

 but he saw only the father 	7.489099087316886

 the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 	2.848395273631369

 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched 	10.081689421522327

 and already had <title> bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all 	4.007988132852126

 and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be 	4.404472729864627

 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball 	4.194829153973325

 and a report soon followed that <title> bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly 	6.281880176978673

 the girls grieved over such a number of ladies 	6.6339041215307715

 but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin 	4.450233068774936

 and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether 	3.9448023701146764

 <title> bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man 	5.5231219058956365

 <title> bingley was good looking and gentleman like 	5.701778589110516

 he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners 	5.350700479854819

 his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion 	3.5418063964200153

 his brother in law <title> hurst merely looked the gentleman 	4.69011528660442

 but his friend <title> darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien 	3.923652358244451

 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than <title> bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity 	4.935480552171098

 for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased 	5.980740303168521

 and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend 	3.7651677768373983

 <title> bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room 	5.219762010650618

 he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield 	3.208332907520241

 such amiable qualities must speak for themselves 	5.203362195230226

 what a contrast between him and his friend <title> darcy danced only once with <title> hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party 	4.2923038396921145

 his character was decided 	13.438429094896383

 he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again 	5.4484875666759605

 amongst the most violent against him was <title> bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters 	5.269837233228859

 elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances 	5.839109549703104

 and during part of that time <title> darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and <title> bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it 	6.26438147045819

 i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner 	4.1430819266682395

 you had much better dance 	15.414366117054758

 i certainly shall not 	11.013208151893066

 at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable 	7.8147223637822965

 your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with 	6.3262308764123905

 i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening 	4.769962641866025

 and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 	5.847821788706669

 you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said <title> darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet 	8.53608478792886

 do let me ask my partner to introduce you 	4.8563763153351385

 which do you mean 	13.165823853128709

 and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable 	3.567464257516984

 but not handsome enough to tempt me  	8.199187714430622

 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me 	4.166053308492653

 <title> bingley followed his advice 	10.19737401890852

 <title> darcy walked off 	15.076582993735382

 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends 	5.351491839509113

 for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous 	5.834661460170891

 the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family 	7.259818885842748

 <title> bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party 	5.894830698200608

 <title> bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters 	6.41209138069397

 jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way 	8.387628783356208

 elizabeth felt jane s pleasure 	13.60818376252987

 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood 	5.6240674872330985

 and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 	6.325336921665577

 they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants 	6.887186113141509

 they found <title> bennet still up 	12.532045994997498

 with a book he was regardless of time 	9.928552785400553

 and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations 	5.335473909496741

 he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed 	7.607571265470247

 i wish you had been there 	9.12221755346711

 jane was so admired nothing could be like it 	7.449627832822843

 every body said how well she looked 	6.240874878902423

 and <title> bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice 	5.461280296257426

 only think of that my dear 	19.007422833421188

 he actually danced with her twice 	8.218586541752925

 and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time 	6.521835328222298

 first of all he asked miss lucas 	12.233147593110633

 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her 	5.376090419392484

 and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance 	7.487603617427927

 so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next 	7.94388499580003

 then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners 	4.690162379255039

 oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh my dear continued <title> bennet i am quite delighted with him 	5.977320812637476

 he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women 	5.056373807920235

 i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses 	3.5750407905582784

 i dare say the lace upon <title> hurst s gown here she was interrupted again 	4.415190032304867

 <title> bennet protested against any description of finery 	4.904338807965577

 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of <title> darcy 	2.935512758660683

 but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy 	3.9495957887751065

 for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing 	4.610276157033369

 so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs 	4.8250024325374925

 i quite detest the man 	7.64735984862924

 chapter iv 	44.72575127815273

 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of <title> bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him 	5.403356223943288

 he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively 	7.81308570023038

 and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can 	4.479862768067396

 i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time 	6.637810275492761

 i did not expect such a compliment 	10.053038514470412

 i did for you 	15.689634805369282

 but that is one great difference between us 	6.648455127273863

 compliments always take you by surprise and me never 	5.136285304586979

 what could be more natural than his asking you again 	4.776529790139382

 he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room 	3.458529483181555

 no thanks to his gallantry for that 	9.27893573293632

 well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him 	7.907386945794283

 you have liked many a stupider person 	4.953690474897554

 dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general 	5.304528353998453

 you never see a fault in any body 	7.423498436896894

 all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes 	7.675191502929457

 i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life 	5.917787309542703

 i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one 	4.779719020939314

 but i always speak what i think 	6.042713337375516

 i know you do 	10.579599125133207

 and it is that which makes the wonder 	5.362372129562533

 with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough 	3.8950953317770036

 one meets it every where 	5.842113880020603

 but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 	4.354123048161467

 and so you like this man s sisters too do you 	3.502146438005819

 their manners are not equal to his 	10.074078987663237

 at first 	61.273699235382196

 miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house 	7.459581277101754

 and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her 	5.210731169670911

 elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced 	9.15529233301307

 their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general 	5.9426688907465275

 and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them 	3.9576418066796424

 they were in fact very fine ladies 	7.080959994139687

 not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it 	5.267320184320573

 but proud and conceited 	13.852864413154792

 they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank 	3.695293047213682

 and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others 	4.041927553036777

 they were of a respectable family in the north of england 	8.239160341235968

 <title> bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it 	4.075913419537642

 <title> bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county 	4.535930399241902

 but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase 	5.209685791801408

 but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was <title> hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her 	3.904472140539238

 <title> bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house 	4.362931379383773

 he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately 	5.394372280241888

 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character 	7.199591112004202

 bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied 	3.8116559741293305

 on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion 	5.416059548482605

 in understanding darcy was the superior 	15.13456725611467

 bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever 	4.978514218782097

 he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting 	4.046453913903383

 bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence 	4.104801872282005

 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic 	5.493087392820307

 every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room 	5.506165685481514

 darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure 	3.735434445131169

 <title> hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of 	4.832532596891344

 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose 	6.004996894371761

 sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty 	4.275060708285221

 the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly 	3.340019720687321

 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town 	7.227958749872037

 and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 	3.365664817638597

 for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious 	4.315617313029161

 on the contrary he was all attention to every body 	9.06596953892539

 by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st 	2.837582853867917

 james s had made him courteous 	7.447162287405472

 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to <title> bennet 	4.301685542061797

 they had several children 	13.554947452106681

 the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend 	4.669329482916874

 that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary 	4.4426341207663995

 and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate 	7.238237794351435

 you began the evening well charlotte said <title> bennet with civil self command to miss lucas 	4.334766805662726

 you were <title> bingley s first choice 	11.091016507619194

 but he seemed to like his second better 	8.229857936272046

 oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice 	6.669911393888782

 to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about <title> robinson 	4.648859198169859

 did not i mention it to you 	15.410662767464823

 <title> robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest 	4.670714708059498

 and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point 	3.6342636721121706

 upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know 	3.781286849809331

 my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte 	4.44739934126962

 poor eliza to be only just tolerable  	11.04867784121577

 for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him 	6.377614062095678

 <title> long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips 	4.747337856667922

 is not there a little mistake 	12.42853278780243

 i certainly saw <title> darcy speaking to her 	8.498479547295746

 aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her 	5.988563161508474

 but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to 	5.527065396570096

 miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance 	4.32324000615232

 with them he is remarkably agreeable 	17.52223106074816

 i do not mind his not talking to <title> long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza 	6.771599039806986

 another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you 	6.19939533400838

 i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him 	4.617366227921516

 his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it 	4.174736084897321

 that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine  	6.094868678774045

 pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe 	4.1318161162294285

 by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary 	4.063874349966316

 vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously 	3.177144177876763

 a person may be proud without being vain 	9.240282106902875

 if i were as rich as <title> darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was 	5.163685296936141

 i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day 	2.227910138746649

 then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said <title> bennet 	5.914766128909191

 and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly 	5.52419936801109

 the boy protested that she should not 	8.83779631504084

 she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit 	7.99659489725427

 chapter vi 	44.72575127815273

 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield 	5.106729080775613

 the visit was returned in due form 	5.484408033091007

 miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of <title> hurst and miss bingley 	6.389004259036462

 but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them 	4.741671766198842

 though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration 	5.292339016895695

 and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love 	8.490140177154217

 but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent 	4.602471633943207

 she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas 	7.01265740314439

 it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case 	5.913559164422491

 but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 	7.017941704908359

 if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him 	6.642536019950217

 there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself 	4.662449547135554

 in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels 	4.206346142957065

 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly 	15.007804228006416

 but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on 	5.726296232062672

 but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow 	5.85864478463147

 if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too 	5.17072778239216

 remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do 	7.327569078178515

 perhaps he must if he sees enough of her 	7.449907123066629

 but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together 	4.160043659793827

 and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together 	4.11635783377517

 jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention 	4.898722319563422

 when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses 	7.235210812361449

 your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married 	5.344564628634614

 and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it 	4.160838684321245

 but these are not jane s feelings 	13.916885403875892

 she is not acting by design 	7.566249001247717

 as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness 	6.921575993850528

 she has known him only a fortnight 	7.930146103825987

 she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times 	4.162317740023751

 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character 	5.504257224970336

 not as you represent it 	14.652258290397224

 had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite 	6.16322543659722

 but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal 	3.2270292947925583

 well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart 	4.467023341380219

 and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth 	5.848724534305601

 if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least 	3.6654193504173467

 they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation 	3.4626717134808693

 and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life 	7.460758315152277

 but it is not sound 	9.595690072589791

 you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself 	8.058832692306835

 occupied in observing <title> bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend 	5.629677401270362

 he had looked at her without admiration at the ball 	8.450017052596358

 and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise 	4.853272267727606

 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes 	4.642818797544713

 to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying 	4.870425645837771

 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing 	4.833098779638927

 and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness 	5.360505088704366

 of this she was perfectly unaware 	28.15501957387111

 to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with 	5.806501368784195

 he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others 	7.780009803760592

 his doing so drew her notice 	4.387072069871636

 it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled 	5.318461043510152

 what does <title> darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster 	5.206220926312925

 that is a question which <title> darcy only can answer 	7.785845415916168

 but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about 	6.644932670424782

 he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him 	3.8223103392802016

 with great energy 	52.0069775172456

 but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic 	4.552941661103071

 you are severe on us 	7.461055610954584

 it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas 	7.079148718125004

 you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers 	3.7783021637231955

 on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well 	6.614516968281711

 if it must be so it must 	14.860564743829713

 and gravely glancing at <title> darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song 	3.1140633151674058

 her performance was pleasing though by no means capital 	4.168108125201335

 after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display 	3.650565811758741

 mary had neither genius nor taste 	4.7489406964706165

 and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room 	3.4498532386604195

 <title> darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began 	4.563655951812089

 i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies 	7.302771475660656

 certainly sir 	89.36620967129394

 and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world 	5.50031734065524

 every savage can dance 	9.953831508730469

 sir william only smiled 	14.81829190510751

 your friend performs delightfully 	12.223529927165256

 he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group 	4.864177608028478

 and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself <title> darcy 	5.427023662282003

 yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight 	4.543809729769914

 do you often dance at st 	6.3558245116009475

 never sir 	89.36620967129394

 do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place 	8.291822246391893

 it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 	6.983072508399238

 you have a house in town i conclude 	7.266294519338659

 <title> darcy bowed 	37.2452216955849

 i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society 	5.180430823669333

 but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas 	4.598343882580076

 he paused in hopes of an answer 	8.308951073427608

 but his companion was not disposed to make any 	8.584266568798094

 and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing 	4.637984713311002

 <title> darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 	6.64384126047075

 you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you 	5.047828562638471

 and taking her hand he would have given it to <title> darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing 	5.117262497657121

 i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner 	5.557612959914395

 <title> darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand 	7.081415559015863

 elizabeth was determined 	14.392663433659441

 you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you 	6.165515846252849

 and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour 	3.4850922808453686

 <title> darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling 	7.728994791500658

 he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance 	3.6978223021814145

 for who would object to such a partner 	11.967617390452919

 elizabeth looked archly and turned away 	4.273258635107612

 i should imagine not 	14.409637504927785

 you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society 	4.9326318475424005

 and indeed i am quite of your opinion 	12.172431415106805

 i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise 	3.57686542836298

 the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you 	2.7032957398545676

 my mind was more agreeably engaged 	10.673256355706489

 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow 	4.779990706004506

 miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 	3.659904052289556

 <title> darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet 	6.424655331762839

 miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley 	6.853903632634111

 i am all astonishment 	13.127211069520305

 how long has she been such a favourite 	11.874366965522904

 and pray when am i to wish you joy 	5.3308426491043495

 that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask 	6.471377027060287

 it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment 	3.2208866949997224

 i knew you would be wishing me joy 	8.804540387028334

 nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled 	5.958227670892393

 you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you 	5.25703531590027

 he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long 	5.092085877139997

 <title> bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation 	2.4177182435383986

 and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his 	3.5161774604243132

 her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds 	4.384618316734989

 she had a sister married to a <title> philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 	5.448094412406978

 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton 	6.3485573946872975

 a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way 	3.4614044507316013

 their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening 	2.645645157697971

 it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters 	7.500887867603287

 their visits to <title> philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence 	7.684145202466556

 every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections 	5.928891124632662

 their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves 	6.263471056880342

 <title> philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before 	4.715476486345372

 they could talk of nothing but officers 	11.709393516242972

 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject <title> bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country 	5.197541022927697

 i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced 	7.018378483964118

 catherine was disconcerted and made no answer 	5.181704111593467

 but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london 	4.961367347588162

 i am astonished my dear said <title> bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 	6.096411752885576

 if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however 	8.295125473885856

 if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it 	6.0068580267943466

 yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever 	6.605216761089515

 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish 	4.437835939451328

 my dear <title> bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother 	6.283445375870009

 when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 	4.463875975060199

 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart 	4.21845397886157

 and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him 	2.8211212778533916

 and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals 	5.499573002015851

 she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library 	3.064688762411628

 <title> bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet 	4.650749846193083

 it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer 	6.516083941191487

 <title> bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from 	3.679792571561273

 what is it about 	24.532777431831487

 what does he say 	10.66844063484298

 well jane make haste and tell us 	5.594409179140656

 make haste my love 	12.845867015367823

 it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud 	8.598708182436066

 my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel 	4.064109346858153

 come as soon as you can on the receipt of this 	8.115745025651085

 my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers 	11.61248810679946

 yours ever caroline bingley 	10.39905781005453

 with the officers cried lydia 	16.394412860587508

 i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that  	7.888864839734109

 dining out said <title> bennet that is very unlucky 	9.962027501794902

 no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain 	5.237304078677779

 and then you must stay all night 	8.01176959001836

 that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home 	7.599509161270599

 and the hursts have no horses to theirs 	5.772382042728464

 but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure 	4.16738795613678

 they are wanted in the farm <title> bennet are not they 	9.17682284943293

 they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them 	4.6091597245553215

 but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered 	7.7695523034349

 she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged 	6.44845058806492

 jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day 	5.718094263252591

 her hopes were answered 	9.452871691401933

 jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 	5.220681752138334

 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission 	6.543410195773195

 jane certainly could not come back 	12.26649987443495

 this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said <title> bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own 	5.321019460151305

 till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 	9.806757281406778

 breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday 	3.5805893605164103

 they insist also on my seeing <title> jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me 	4.503065627019885

 yours & <initial> well my dear said <title> bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of <title> bingley and under your orders 	4.304862846603172

 oh i am not at all afraid of her dying 	14.02655104004768

 people do not die of little trifling colds 	8.072320434356115

 she will be taken good care of 	7.115784994832428

 as long as she stays there it is all very well 	7.54258807663637

 elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had 	7.496523963419428

 and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative 	4.78552748004146

 she declared her resolution 	14.556210862072051

 how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there 	5.533951995362395

 i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want 	6.105166707499846

 is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses 	6.654576881661521

 no indeed 	41.25700063866114

 i do not wish to avoid the walk 	6.651195284339455

 only three miles 	21.087389807306387

 i shall be back by dinner 	6.858275885406316

 i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason 	3.5327263609685757

 and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required 	6.824540485326785

 elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together 	6.2916009617615485

 if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes 	3.5146077439671526

 in meryton they parted 	17.271169306545737

 the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 	2.679508492218837

 she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise 	3.482775671903909

 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to <title> hurst and miss bingley 	4.824290234304842

 and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it 	5.489468114934105

 she was received however very politely by them 	4.4864791769388574

 and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness 	7.468849548990969

 there was good humour and kindness 	9.884820388028691

 <title> darcy said very little and <title> hurst nothing at all 	7.5135008620950225

 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone 	4.696469094972658

 the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 	9.649120204899393

 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered 	9.70807806236997

 elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately 	15.713182803467909

 and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance 	5.045356299616085

 she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with 	4.479814899728019

 elizabeth silently attended her 	12.027035599098566

 when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters 	9.651218701735539

 and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane 	4.576074057175713

 advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts 	6.595081634105157

 the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely 	4.255571563748848

 elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent 	5.868437904880642

 when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go 	5.413362169761327

 and very unwillingly said so 	8.72295481629029

 miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 	4.281160473203926

 elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes 	3.1600122237016

 to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of <title> bingley s she could not make a very favourable answer 	4.014580088938978

 jane was by no means better 	8.352372064060908

 and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 	4.222825242121848

 their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency 	7.107526092508229

 his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others 	5.3254893226510065

 she had very little notice from any but him 	5.236342294615112

 miss bingley was engrossed by <title> darcy her sister scarcely less so 	7.597693213546492

 and as for <title> hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her 	3.1875979368377005

 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence 	5.042910728926679

 she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty 	3.190844185606418

 i shall never forget her appearance this morning 	4.077261253380295

 she really looked almost wild 	6.8326367793394445

 she did indeed louisa 	17.200402780728655

 very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold 	5.410364846225902

 her hair so untidy so blowsy yes and her petticoat 	4.824999730265347

 i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain 	3.9899479051739197

 your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley 	5.211102274119862

 but this was all lost upon me 	6.809131152601138

 i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning 	4.254738609847836

 her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 	3.609649282696106

 you observed it <title> darcy i am sure said miss bingley 	6.784033889060494

 and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition 	6.949340220928996

 to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it 	2.8789370523739857

 it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum 	3.545035497615864

 it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley 	7.388737809456019

 i am afraid <title> darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes 	4.174548136045691

 not at all he replied 	14.160205378787468

 a short pause followed this speech and <title> hurst began again 	5.6382280443134585

 and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside 	5.156460809729239

 that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily 	5.303798221172508

 if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable 	4.358560142417406

 to this speech bingley made no answer 	4.8211504991069125

 but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations 	3.1809309407337754

 with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee 	3.7303836172120923

 she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself 	4.7773360153868865

 <title> hurst looked at her with astonishment 	8.514379501344175

 do you prefer reading to cards 	5.662395910110231

 said he 	28.515427497255985

 that is rather singular 	11.491498483120619

 she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else 	5.324790515602597

 i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth 	2.580196392515955

 i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things 	8.889559393303543

 in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley 	6.348816716078131

 and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well 	5.166179877445238

 elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying 	6.096952634789434

 he immediately offered to fetch her others 	6.167782945660085

 all that his library afforded 	21.69989150930092

 and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit 	4.557365288482577

 i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books 	4.678805419353087

 what a delightful library you have at pemberley <title> darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations 	5.877434489770899

 i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 	4.837953730479896

 neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place 	5.267073867758478

 charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley 	4.057873393148443

 i wish it may 	9.997769202053911

 but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model 	5.3902802595377945

 there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire 	4.771716200410437

 with all my heart 	18.39585656835554

 i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it 	3.137765800880835

 i am talking of possibilities charles 	7.698125699535692

 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation 	4.437468007903423

 elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book 	7.7488382409156005

 and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between <title> bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game 	3.334285240684439

 is miss darcy much grown since the spring 	7.346998017303526

 said miss bingley 	24.513858744392618

 will she be as tall as i am 	6.419404921963822

 i think she will 	12.066758240359658

 she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller 	4.194579662020162

 how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 	3.583853889109539

 such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite 	4.349021832668448

 it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are 	5.3907963975052615

 all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean 	5.639475773900706

 yes all of them i think 	10.736018732275419

 they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses 	3.0391673643588475

 i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished 	4.6327582010981585

 your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth 	5.900600946306686

 but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general 	4.526451638096668

 i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished 	4.775688557763898

 nor i i am sure said miss bingley 	6.027720725758026

 i do comprehend a great deal in it 	6.29487590102496

 oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with 	3.1567945945613274

 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word 	4.547699091406401

 and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved 	3.598148442276682

 all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 	4.970038513135683

 i rather wonder now at your knowing any  	4.144706080351508

 are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this 	5.647313523097239

 i never saw such a woman 	7.90766560989069

 i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united 	2.988466284392761

 <title> hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when <title> hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward 	3.2419094374975534

 as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 	4.3963355586850525

 eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own 	4.290566125664773

 and with many men i dare say it succeeds 	5.323995558770729

 but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art 	7.14316456485241

 undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation 	3.0878217564683945

 miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject 	5.678044846730521

 bingley urged <title> jones s being sent for immediately 	5.459667933857076

 while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians 	5.074341266864128

 this she would not hear of 	15.360072624086321

 but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal 	6.267981434048956

 and it was settled that <title> jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better 	6.271584265499118

 bingley was quite uncomfortable 	19.63942023749598

 his sisters declared that they were miserable 	10.467209547844597

 they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister 	3.2555947756885626

 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from <title> bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters 	6.078440976023243

 in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation 	5.3402029807283355

 the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with 	3.2192659266245784

 <title> bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast 	5.8377967832757856

 had she found jane in any apparent danger <title> bennet would have been very miserable 	7.401815606919096

 but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield 	4.402315379394746

 she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home 	6.831850263832384

 neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable 	5.4661683421775225

 after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 	3.3876320781982794

 bingley met them with hopes that <title> bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected 	6.113496961100585

 indeed i have sir was her answer 	8.68820549845264

 she is a great deal too ill to be moved 	7.195570934113929

 <title> jones says we must not think of moving her 	7.865454335686794

 we must trespass a little longer on your kindness 	5.126621139535181

 it must not be thought of 	11.90069987714976

 my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal 	13.529770421403938

 you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us 	3.1281844771780287

 <title> bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments 	7.830635255517765

 i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with 	4.428563331223181

 i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her  	4.432370071353037

 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield 	6.192141067949473

 you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease 	7.515701513287304

 whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he 	7.334515025487761

 and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes 	4.840584318222988

 at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here 	3.8211792842083585

 that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth 	6.992876172398221

 you begin to comprehend me do you 	6.036780232885056

 cried he turning towards her 	6.156580640478415

 i wish i might take this for a compliment 	6.8819356971657655

 but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 	5.324995401410938

 that is as it happens 	18.83147623968102

 it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours 	3.385312407119174

 lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home 	6.404348006038137

 i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character 	3.8051888056193

 it must be an amusing study 	8.524451238781761

 but intricate characters are the most amusing 	9.316012418866379

 they have at least that advantage 	9.025975662630753

 the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study 	4.4195604695903805

 in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society 	4.3439947113357436

 but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever 	4.434172005540797

 yes indeed cried <title> bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 	5.016324482473704

 i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town 	7.206733884526516

 every body was surprised 	11.469929648383028

 and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away 	5.596151025250361

 <title> bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph 	3.951020704861698

 i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places 	2.8997827756279766

 the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it <title> bingley 	5.666212568128239

 when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it 	9.253082638098864

 and when i am in town it is pretty much the same 	8.857249083345286

 they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either 	5.455765217885762

 aye that is because you have the right disposition 	15.760881893574828

 but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all 	6.828603709331528

 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true 	6.708094299553228

 certainly my dear nobody said there were 	7.471018677569887

 i know we dine with four and twenty families 	4.913541947319779

 nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance 	6.81249198926507

 his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards <title> darcy with a very expressive smile 	6.11487324464851

 elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away 	4.320215581368622

 yes she called yesterday with her father 	5.139874417887067

 what an agreeable man sir william is <title> bingley is not he 	9.145755685352318

 so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body 	5.345623584234025

 and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter 	2.280001973704354

 did charlotte dine with you 	9.770517123498836

 no she would go home 	14.020775915555213

 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies 	7.753783375187316

 for my part <title> bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work 	4.8491804366601965

 my daughters are brought up differently 	7.658903539730472

 but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you 	4.980921294243269

 it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend 	4.614445604742794

 she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley 	6.186459013849676

 oh dear yes 	20.942023889193578

 but you must own she is very plain 	9.618652810521098

 i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking 	4.191675156122549

 it is what every body says 	11.079376479631557

 i do not trust my own partiality 	8.218415253495834

 when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away 	5.148587244140578

 but however he did not 	7.220801992550906

 perhaps he thought her too young 	10.49292358597161

 however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were 	6.7779459200436225

 and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently 	7.100436154218016

 there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way 	6.440262657683553

 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy 	2.844008023450327

 of a fine stout healthy love it may 	7.806878391827446

 every thing nourishes what is strong already 	8.596995638749956

 but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away 	4.207020709995491

 darcy only smiled 	30.8400094016236

 she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say 	5.977458219321269

 and after a short silence <title> bennet began repeating her thanks to <title> bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy 	3.741703088827676

 <title> bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required 	4.705147202639815

 she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but <title> bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 	3.392738128889059

 upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 	4.695678717267351

 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax <title> bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield 	5.140191581614659

 lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance 	4.547756263318483

 a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 	5.816818845999463

 she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance 	3.952579685703819

 she was very equal therefore to address <title> bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise 	5.104781314562853

 adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 	6.831110611859567

 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear 	5.290984888311682

 i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement 	5.776524123621109

 and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball 	4.934370796003307

 but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill 	9.786893525226851

 oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again 	4.620871362316372

 and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also 	5.151258817804314

 i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not 	4.469597572151491

 <title> bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and <title> darcy 	6.409973402037761

 the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes  	4.832337298377949

 chapter <initial> the day passed much as the day before had done 	7.4893694413126966

 <title> hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend 	4.5856539834790055

 and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room 	4.673164262053462

 the loo table however did not appear 	5.775477425926427

 <title> darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister 	3.272666097661796

 <title> hurst and <title> bingley were at piquet and <title> hurst was observing their game 	6.540511847798782

 elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion 	3.994194083039331

 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 	4.431623276742494

 you write uncommonly fast 	12.35425385964239

 i write rather slowly 	11.483183172548978

 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours 	3.860892151535436

 pray tell your sister that i long to see her 	8.115914271898447

 i have already told her so once by your desire 	5.527845451193673

 i am afraid you do not like your pen 	6.601241343143641

 let me mend it for you 	6.780100812848601

 i mend pens remarkably well 	6.657413423952346

 thank you but i always mend my own 	8.534633838945469

 how can you contrive to write so even 	4.7063872855295

 he was silent 	20.3424619501021

 tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley <initial> will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again 	4.363851828935254

 at present i have not room to do them justice 	7.401964574685681

 oh it is of no consequence 	18.00295004749214

 i shall see her in january 	14.317148233729132

 but do you always write such charming long letters to her <title> darcy 	4.191515417670264

 they are generally long 	9.990796594274302

 but whether always charming it is not for me to determine 	7.140544561340014

 it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill 	3.706682000351574

 that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease 	5.863402226496265

 he studies too much for words of four syllables 	4.35981113993693

 do not you darcy 	19.621584752833215

 oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 	5.806801041791729

 my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents 	3.4385122563617427

 your humility <title> bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof 	7.600559616015251

 nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility 	6.6828071421994215

 it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast 	3.3450982485761256

 and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty 	7.631525554525216

 for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting 	3.3778948764912866

 the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance 	4.6923069726189635

 when you told <title> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else 	4.07241905929885

 and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment 	6.176847462321177

 at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies 	3.854544943771261

 i dare say you believed it 	6.376623548878296

 but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity 	8.795356101649245

 your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know 	4.596136961348007

 and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month 	3.6669938521052132

 you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <title> bingley did not do justice to his own disposition 	6.938162328192808

 you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself 	5.541791631783743

 i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper 	4.242108739689796

 for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could 	4.113723398690961

 would <title> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it 	3.045269844650883

 upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself 	3.838449170720762

 you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged 	4.662213991209502

 allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety 	3.822243928627879

 to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you 	5.15606782323471

 to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either 	5.055955315243383

 you appear to me <title> darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 	5.656455877019622

 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 	2.755759724864914

 i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about <title> bingley 	5.889605969429049

 we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon 	3.9421187197780463

 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it 	3.8412673258184165

 by all means cried bingley 	6.21143824022117

 let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size 	3.8413895116418737

 for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of 	8.4871733688517

 i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places 	3.4470846110007303

 at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do 	7.145645707859016

 but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended 	9.307608697225792

 and therefore checked her laugh 	6.370298063717807

 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense 	3.889767580884896

 you dislike an argument and want to silence this 	4.552061637491091

 perhaps i do 	19.941705572912404

 arguments are too much like disputes 	10.837772332589171

 if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful 	8.708523666931606

 and then you may say whatever you like of me 	5.453017718061415

 and <title> darcy had much better finish his letter 	6.10536639654797

 <title> darcy took her advice and did finish his letter 	4.066498092433716

 when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 	8.761897950498945

 miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself 	3.508991403648257

 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man 	5.308560230329481

 and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange 	6.563029076178596

 she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present 	4.065670077083824

 the supposition did not pain her 	13.083180702001634

 she liked him too little to care for his approbation 	8.09421445062091

 after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air 	3.705726598978809

 and soon afterwards <title> darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel 	5.211464919260667

 she smiled but made no answer 	4.839663262583463

 oh said she i heard you before 	8.651854299748928

 but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply 	7.317279192415977

 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare 	4.832393837365117

 indeed i do not dare 	19.39569063711295

 but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody 	4.903878060442943

 and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her 	8.093065321781507

 he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger 	9.035098479439178

 miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous 	7.436054862630947

 and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth 	4.20060472580045

 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance 	3.464451642881217

 and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers 	3.822919728715032

 have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity 	5.168210885563073

 do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley 	4.650346449051513

 put them next to your great uncle the judge 	5.289392016694002

 they are in the same profession you know 	9.664685125106868

 only in different lines 	11.702391374599765

 as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes 	4.564632022860445

 it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied 	3.2228410974772905

 at that moment they were met from another walk by <title> hurst and elizabeth herself 	5.379722145388064

 i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard 	6.510110862418417

 you used us abominably ill answered <title> hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out 	3.1092320712231913

 then taking the disengaged arm of <title> darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself 	4.579754177809478

 the path just admitted three 	5.995045044190794

 we had better go into the avenue 	9.400796489867497

 but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no 	5.334769063438345

 stay where you are 	11.168801267322337

 you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage 	3.5391176738817762

 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth 	4.890392835166732

 she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 	5.1689556668005565

 chapter xi 	44.72575127815273

 when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room 	3.0064709201684687

 where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure 	5.227645745380226

 their powers of conversation were considerable 	6.646375110175434

 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit 	2.8564342988524927

 but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object 	6.815761570462494

 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation 	8.802958540944408

 <title> hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad 	9.136914816418699

 but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation 	4.757201793391598

 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room 	4.684515004878242

 and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door 	6.046695892381085

 he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else 	5.7496702063803085

 elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight 	5.685667045419859

 when tea was over <title> hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain 	6.075557587591899

 she had obtained private intelligence that <title> darcy did not wish for cards 	8.13927680813551

 and <title> hurst soon found even his open petition rejected 	4.1295577605974385

 she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her 	7.237945012647164

 <title> hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep 	4.931662440528496

 miss bingley did the same 	13.343043899676982

 miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching <title> darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own 	4.416836339605549

 she could not win him however to any conversation 	7.494665994427774

 he merely answered her question and read on 	4.504224663547891

 at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library 	4.966162314577093

 no one made any reply 	7.1937074407905595

 she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement 	3.2127176000844804

 i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party 	4.999196450097801

 i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 	4.509261623143008

 if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing 	6.058801266411208

 and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards 	3.1977393714892055

 i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner 	4.861461199394133

 but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 	6.521960858179384

 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day 	3.9245130636072987

 much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball 	6.8480493194034935

 miss bingley made no answer 	7.873764482150995

 and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 	4.571055244856238

 her figure was elegant and she walked well 	8.202529554917492

 but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious 	4.586849192873094

 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more 	9.227047075897046

 and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room 	4.649621258595874

 i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude 	4.341702121070639

 elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately 	4.801004972052622

 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility 	9.99349447020036

 <title> darcy looked up 	15.066022852709407

 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book 	4.026607973785124

 he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere 	2.908238389959602

 what could he mean 	17.473410002863915

 she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him 	5.021829806984373

 not at all was her answer 	12.485352349784735

 but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it 	3.7573766520997496

 miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <title> darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives 	4.990277782127234

 you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking 	3.311389103538937

 if the first i should be completely in your way 	9.736395271722976

 and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire 	6.575806358715163

 i never heard any thing so abominable 	7.571673583419821

 how shall we punish him for such a speech 	6.975056307799623

 nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth 	8.06166503701669

 teaze him laugh at him 	9.09275760655048

 intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done 	16.271312288367884

 but upon my honour i do not  	5.677621470795822

 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that  	5.0203422177527655

 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there 	3.847626641575078

 <title> darcy may hug himself 	8.075708711375727

 <title> darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth 	6.322143244955455

 i dearly love a laugh 	7.64735984862924

 miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be 	6.865634563948557

 the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke 	4.335556964947379

 certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them  	6.068663903958432

 i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good 	6.31034535570461

 follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can 	3.4819489298981168

 but these i suppose are precisely what you are without 	5.941864583383994

 perhaps that is not possible for any one 	8.111934195457042

 but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule 	3.6632672072125825

 such as vanity and pride 	11.263312079241684

 yes vanity is a weakness indeed 	11.025327528600698

 but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation 	4.392237255595234

 your examination of <title> darcy is over i presume said miss bingley 	4.167448691784927

 and pray what is the result 	8.502349721810637

 i am perfectly convinced by it that <title> darcy has no defect 	5.892080310511787

 he owns it himself without disguise 	5.26236856465914

 no said darcy i have made no such pretension 	14.45971004046826

 i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding 	6.991459066410749

 my temper i dare not vouch for 	7.086654028939694

 it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world 	4.5814140299403965

 i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself 	3.301363557269327

 my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them 	4.199066718805871

 my temper would perhaps be called resentful 	4.548103524240261

 my good opinion once lost is lost for ever 	3.5970176606617015

 that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth 	7.204967948143137

 implacable resentment is a shade in a character 	11.328877585227993

 but you have chosen your fault well 	6.782414017208102

 i really cannot laugh at it 	7.535202516871229

 and your defect is a propensity to hate every body 	4.664442204701156

 and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them 	4.404272162615611

 do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share 	6.465701051587347

 louisa you will not mind my waking <title> hurst 	6.089111156102501

 her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it 	4.885312017341673

 he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 	6.159488786378015

 chapter xii 	44.72575127815273

 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day 	5.519240744008161

 but <title> bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before 	4.123287319559084

 <title> bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday 	5.923469822318118

 and in her postscript it was added that if <title> bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well 	6.190094747211598

 and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow <title> bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made 	3.5781920884052925

 the communication excited many professions of concern 	4.204614806653862

 and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane 	4.841822216094185

 and till the morrow their going was deferred 	4.84360666759533

 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 	4.2649494371733665

 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered 	5.348385706625712

 but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right 	9.334514347495238

 to <title> darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough 	8.237947424744549

 she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself 	4.893728096453319

 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity 	3.393559794200754

 sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it 	4.877317337854367

 steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her 	3.7150097062092606

 on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place 	2.8567448236575275

 miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane 	4.822963005602256

 and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former 	4.514999857551672

 elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits 	9.936607627836548

 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother 	3.633483238440869

 <title> bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again 	4.471139679402919

 but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them 	4.881772587422935

 he had felt their importance in the family circle 	8.073714502287771

 the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth 	3.725286219715092

 they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature 	3.652816704321234

 and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to 	2.868171905636907

 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort 	8.863760853567586

 several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married 	4.867014048269255

 i hope my dear said <title> bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party 	5.166200124787472

 who do you mean my dear 	9.739884935204744

 i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her 	3.545946098901552

 i do not believe she often sees such at home 	3.5909280739880076

 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger 	6.762068470548286

 <title> bennet s eyes sparkled 	5.975349245440005

 a gentleman and a stranger it is <title> bingley i am sure 	8.23873641817801

 why jane you never dropt a word of this 	4.638088737021869

 you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see <title> bingley 	4.592693864617922

 but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day 	5.439070230770517

 i must speak to hill this moment 	6.5690210673259575

 it is not <title> bingley said her husband 	10.920341254811012

 it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life 	8.597828799071063

 and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once 	4.548932788661241

 after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained 	4.366229400924947

 it is from my cousin <title> collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases 	5.822569453266516

 oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned 	5.378236383919402

 pray do not talk of that odious man 	11.493228467497396

 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children 	4.919001429063165

 and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it 	5.711733218552646

 jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail 	6.902124323191104

 they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which <title> bennet was beyond the reach of reason 	5.266848556441422

 and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 	3.273139798096414

 but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself 	6.951314583000424

 no that i am sure i shall not 	7.301681982076799

 and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical 	10.061219866980975

 i hate such false friends 	6.653682703254872

 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him 	5.042128701348202

 why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear 	5.527740365612832

 hunsford near westerham kent 15th october 	4.996559256118642

 dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach 	3.0645634717941603

 but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance 	4.495183610459981

 there <title> bennet 	23.514250050635106

 my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england 	3.2003601133186708

 as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence 	3.2706581299998683

 and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch 	3.0313293434469393

 i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter 	4.174128742105059

 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 	2.849501324479816

 i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins 	2.569540955963734

 at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said <title> bennet as he folded up the letter 	3.357307492279591

 he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word 	4.9869411703001605

 and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again 	3.9349875150858296

 there is some sense in what he says about the girls however 	6.7919444133462905

 and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him 	5.931676450770163

 though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit 	3.74588593369522

 elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required 	3.4215413024810077

 he must be an oddity i think said she 	7.249844572743478

 i cannot make him out 	12.157375724803723

 there is something very pompous in his style 	6.864233486838554

 and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail 	3.9636181023951957

 can he be a sensible man sir 	9.32533592952791

 no my dear 	15.901509971791555

 i think not 	31.726806623862313

 i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse 	4.977865092050653

 there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well 	4.442050535922932

 i am impatient to see him 	7.159035954567808

 the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed 	5.799934169113867

 to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 	5.18579308428883

 as for their mother <title> collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters 	5.116770839244236

 <title> collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family 	6.469749727380139

 <title> bennet indeed said little 	10.600851293024762

 but the ladies were ready enough to talk and <title> collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself 	4.405106028401188

 he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty 	4.581255410709549

 he had not been long seated before he complimented <title> bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth 	4.4367754404244995

 and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 	3.959080609423424

 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but <title> bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure 	5.301126693662224

 and i wish with all my heart it may prove so 	5.643442242210229

 for else they will be destitute enough 	10.480140125147834

 things are settled so oddly 	7.917922558837253

 you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate 	11.108418754818002

 ah sir i do indeed 	19.72785297516442

 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess 	5.2751938546895305

 not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world 	7.13618605511539

 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed 	4.056768360195985

 i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 	4.654920332024389

 at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner 	4.503243209259164

 and the girls smiled on each other 	6.392062131467835

 they were not the only objects of <title> collins s admiration 	9.307774519173988

 the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised 	5.276693756174284

 and his commendation of every thing would have touched <title> bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property 	5.625630160970145

 but here he was set right by <title> bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 	6.1245368970885306

 he begged pardon for having displeased her 	5.805848067401517

 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended 	4.504934144059947

 but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 	5.053716047254627

 chapter xiv 	44.72575127815273

 but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness 	4.569083586163699

 lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable 	4.575796185420223

 <title> bennet could not have chosen better 	8.604038024178193

 <title> collins was eloquent in her praise 	6.693982699403858

 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 	4.336608073487617

 she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 	4.283810713785881

 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 	3.7379071932094567

 lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her 	3.551630434351606

 she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations 	5.199365645824022

 she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion 	4.021945860109425

 and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage 	7.099794752823861

 where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs 	4.110263748201349

 that is all very proper and civil i am sure said <title> bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 	4.234363233215639

 it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 	4.148650197709701

 does she live near you sir 	5.018371160555479

 the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence 	3.203703784405072

 i think you said she was a widow sir 	14.249916223694338

 has she any family 	12.24969581404563

 ah cried <title> bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls 	4.668803618161382

 and what sort of young lady is she 	8.307579483674598

 is she handsome 	20.944769536490437

 she is a most charming young lady indeed 	6.540798828707567

 lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex 	5.079007255590865

 because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth 	7.854977369393334

 she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of 	2.8705627562108256

 as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them 	4.867692437968145

 has she been presented 	13.908592747077034

 i do not remember her name among the ladies at court 	4.255928401109884

 and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament 	4.185377923904967

 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies 	3.8482653336624644

 i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her 	4.504977126561056

 these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 	4.000761236666629

 you judge very properly said <title> bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy 	4.74993401982738

 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study 	3.6033491438461884

 they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 	3.234927448044198

 <title> bennet s expectations were fully answered 	4.027859474713632

 his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure 	4.1339649760558155

 by tea time however the dose had been enough and <title> bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 	5.197725675117096

 <title> collins readily assented and a book was produced 	5.412658631254113

 kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed 	12.52658152913938

 other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons 	3.2571392027480917

 lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him 	3.0306905092770675

 my aunt told me so herself on saturday 	6.3730554520007185

 lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue 	3.4868531114988754

 but <title> collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit 	3.298100869897743

 it amazes me i confess 	11.7583578698872

 but i will no longer importune my young cousin 	4.763346669975666

 <title> bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements 	3.763841473381244

 <title> bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book 	4.102327540920831

 but <title> collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with <title> bennet and prepared for backgammon 	3.2624046221937406

 <title> collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society 	4.6694730086984295

 the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father 	4.488280627087309

 and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance 	3.2545887593851788

 the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity 	3.471417397953851

 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant 	4.338542070488852

 having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry 	4.591267664348096

 this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate 	3.6332543228186034

 and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 	3.585064178433147

 his plan did not vary on seeing them 	7.520355703995566

 miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority 	3.192523776969829

 and for the first evening she was his settled choice 	10.420532723641163

 for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with <title> bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 	3.9621648683274993

 her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged 	5.118431602802277

 <title> collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while <title> bennet was stirring the fire 	5.181011935281276

 elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course 	4.477541742930626

 <title> bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married 	4.5754457646456315

 and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces 	6.990551014560958

 lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten 	9.759580327601492

 for thither <title> collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to <title> bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford 	4.190959074105396

 such doings discomposed <title> bennet exceedingly 	12.027272282747157

 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity 	6.094738604316822

 and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there 	5.929198322204348

 his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting <title> collins to join his daughters in their walk 	4.80955279517497

 and <title> collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go 	3.836745217988833

 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him  	7.168805222059902

 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them 	3.201639318693829

 the officer was the very <title> denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed 	4.125380930340521

 all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 	2.797048399405645

 <title> denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend <title> wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps 	4.244013129586038

 this was exactly as it should be 	11.316765847392338

 for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming 	6.0765086513362085

 his appearance was greatly in his favour 	6.684673238568652

 he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address 	5.4202920844741636

 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming 	2.7291406701838747

 and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street 	2.935147517873997

 on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities 	4.687757259200772

 bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object 	8.500458174744706

 he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her 	6.231859323435999

 both changed colour one looked white the other red 	4.321278338035192

 <title> wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which <title> darcy just deigned to return 	3.535745741699267

 what could be the meaning of it 	6.525871202565065

 it was impossible to imagine 	7.118205558811713

 in another minute <title> bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend 	3.7597389875202514

 <title> denny and <title> wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of <title> philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of <title> philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation 	4.858277418943954

 <title> philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see <title> jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards <title> collins by jane s introduction of him 	3.6051469267265457

 she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 	5.070816855255946

 <title> philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding 	5.99569817069424

 but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that <title> denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire 	4.358392722494856

 she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had <title> wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows 	3.6937995615570527

 some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on <title> wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening 	5.625572839234129

 this was agreed to and <title> philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 	4.387493611443834

 the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits 	4.586838881789559

 <title> collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless 	3.95776489790784

 as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen 	4.343974487850513

 but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister 	4.309545546363515

 <title> collins on his return highly gratified <title> bennet by admiring <title> philips s manners and politeness 	4.803049000259953

 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman 	5.181931460230067

 for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before 	4.935159029838893

 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 	6.9986408215340035

 chapter xvi 	44.72575127815273

 as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all <title> collins s scruples of leaving <title> and <title> bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton 	3.523731955801266

 when this information was given and they had all taken their seats <title> collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings 	4.557764541215228

 a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification 	7.44001026796982

 but when <title> philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room 	4.12879965477795

 in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them 	4.34109106964476

 and he found in <title> philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could 	3.8239566797920634

 to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long 	4.014736440572942

 it was over at last however 	14.489511546665135

 the gentlemen did approach 	11.261738158300178

 and when <title> wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 	5.09025601502742

 the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party 	6.997372312607216

 but <title> wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room 	3.4636989368711975

 <title> wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself 	3.4875965380745826

 and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 	3.8572603120611832

 with such rivals for the notice of the fair as <title> wickham and the officers <title> collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance 	8.268968115575163

 to the young ladies he certainly was nothing 	9.004757299324806

 but he had still at intervals a kind listener in <title> philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin 	3.3149149228405137

 when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist 	4.010534556031914

 i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life <title> philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason 	6.229097015942906

 <title> wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia 	4.431747627111232

 at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker 	6.0043986073373015

 but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular 	3.0965642970261653

 allowing for the common demands of the game <title> wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with <title> darcy 	6.059101642232308

 she dared not even mention that gentleman 	4.677687114557798

 <title> wickham began the subject himself 	13.469107016364235

 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton 	4.13183952048202

 and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long <title> darcy had been staying there 	4.359287796136788

 about a month said elizabeth 	10.170893542281279

 and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand 	4.888556545258583

 yes replied wickham 	17.97753712381486

 his estate there is a noble one 	8.73518556757554

 a clear ten thousand per annum 	7.1880915282844615

 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy 	5.080431935992764

 elizabeth could not but look surprised 	6.567424142373494

 you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 	3.960807224326194

 are you much acquainted with <title> darcy 	6.360500701750572

 as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable 	7.738401665942391

 i am not qualified to form one 	5.6788400790017555

 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge 	5.380617093684584

 it is impossible for me to be impartial 	9.710933064205461

 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else 	4.293855774522311

 here you are in your own family 	16.58500749238488

 upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield 	4.69312007540798

 he is not at all liked in hertfordshire 	8.975129374218232

 every body is disgusted with his pride 	7.5060475782714775

 you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one 	4.752614404776562

 but with him i believe it does not often happen 	8.325656692869734

 i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man 	4.838759643712228

 i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer 	7.58233167939078

 i do not at all know 	8.49774550993124

 but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield 	12.592633762307623

 i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 	7.404120251425929

 we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world 	4.732018789361697

 a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is 	4.353607051728922

 his father miss bennet the late <title> darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had 	5.453251384601685

 and i can never be in company with this <title> darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections 	6.730627977893027

 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous 	10.023885216042375

 but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father 	4.052419559128912

 elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart 	6.99629208197493

 but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry 	5.932468181778772

 <title> wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry 	3.851454101394047

 i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them 	3.3512971795592486

 society i own is necessary to me 	5.998071669090244

 i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude 	5.805633738951146

 a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible 	5.955040145159187

 the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now 	4.960202781113663

 indeed yes the late <title> darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 	7.933546025202494

 he was my godfather and excessively attached to me 	4.030331360751442

 i cannot do justice to his kindness 	7.766321693032072

 he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it 	5.965884919950679

 but when the living fell it was given elsewhere 	7.857054894289137

 good heavens cried elizabeth 	10.062010025471917

 but how could that be 	10.542124585568615

 how could his will be disregarded 	10.764834288842684

 why did not you seek legal redress 	7.119748997621315

 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but <title> darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing 	3.98594312026324

 certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man 	6.9166672417053086

 and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it 	4.887628745448695

 i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely 	5.894318370025419

 i can recal nothing worse 	8.310048034852349

 but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me 	6.184595932722375

 some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me  	9.214417591977615

 till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him  	5.691892625508764

 elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 	5.109407299691612

 but what said she after a pause can have been his motive 	7.814435615237078

 what can have induced him to behave so cruelly 	6.801945956197676

 a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy 	4.713111526530797

 had the late <title> darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better 	5.9503966840670275

 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me 	3.9332361868385295

 i had not thought <title> darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper 	4.087985044537464

 his disposition must be dreadful 	18.41927395880004

 i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him 	4.337643727423858

 elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together 	3.6513095944725023

 inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care 	10.004738084327762

 my father began life in the profession which your uncle <title> philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late <title> darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property 	5.657567266958434

 he was most highly esteemed by <title> darcy a most intimate confidential friend 	6.854368210336046

 <title> darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death <title> darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself 	5.269763872064343

 how strange cried elizabeth 	9.507743125393587

 how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this <title> darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it 	4.683268865054741

 it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride 	4.003946001003745

 and pride has often been his best friend 	5.761761036442215

 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling 	3.7088213113786717

 but we are none of us consistent 	10.410027102065282

 and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride 	6.54116111330997

 can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good 	3.5452033095107574

 it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor 	2.90670591765193

 family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this 	5.93336320122409

 not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive 	4.718687034501544

 he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister 	3.0500212084198894

 and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers 	4.023880491475076

 what sort of a girl is miss darcy 	11.047228137295733

 he shook his head 	7.707788323469259

 but she is too much like her brother very very proud 	8.489684007829077

 as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me 	4.435237618063143

 but she is nothing to me now 	18.093256063656685

 she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished 	3.3915291071369693

 since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education 	4.791968017971273

 after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with <title> bingley how can <title> bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man 	4.20799110282607

 how can they suit each other 	5.448585097498015

 he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man 	4.979928695066487

 he cannot know what <title> darcy is 	7.670067912040819

 probably not 	124.74212174894105

 but <title> darcy can please where he chuses 	7.608706740571083

 he does not want abilities 	13.360541023207059

 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while 	5.063503673310056

 among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous 	6.775239857587367

 his pride never deserts him 	5.821019098702698

 but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure 	3.0846902606129634

 the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and <title> collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and <title> philips 	4.037327203742714

 the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter 	7.79566283745394

 it had not been very great 	14.010106164191974

 he had lost every point 	8.932113509642214

 but when <title> philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy 	4.619266710222906

 i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object 	3.621874139768124

 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 	4.635611018846217

 and after observing <title> collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh 	4.2735395917487935

 lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living 	3.88927495335586

 i hardly know how <title> collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long 	5.85289541263174

 you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters 	4.564093662730521

 consequently that she is aunt to the present <title> darcy 	14.234879320594745

 no indeed i did not 	7.321489987399926

 i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections 	7.42371164701074

 i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 	7.119393225361664

 her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 	7.043667090372105

 this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley 	4.16192269407694

 vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another 	3.9460686552294817

 <title> collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter 	5.287122277431623

 but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman 	4.713210889178352

 i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham 	9.465277680571115

 i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent 	5.7744614084068

 she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever 	3.724506586530368

 but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class 	4.904191194276594

 elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards 	4.368475372096614

 and gave the rest of the ladies their share of <title> wickham s attentions 	8.736427552339713

 there could be no conversation in the noise of <title> philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body 	5.967618704814719

 whatever he said was said well 	10.021128675721787

 and whatever he did done gracefully 	10.123344456614909

 she could think of nothing but of <title> wickham and of what he had told her all the way home 	7.929855168523071

 elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between <title> wickham and herself 	5.145932665015594

 jane listened with astonishment and concern 	7.0619448797181565

 she knew not how to believe that <title> darcy could be so unworthy of <title> bingley s regard 	6.5118984921234055

 and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham 	4.289195524531542

 and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained 	3.8442379870858194

 interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other 	5.384818692693735

 it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side 	2.560633287589265

 very true indeed 	22.29414635847376

 and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business 	4.6997104669662715

 do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody 	4.851869241386805

 laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion 	6.571346793681914

 my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places <title> darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for 	4.233129240507004

 it is impossible 	14.656344344351977

 no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it 	6.260957562396262

 oh no 	34.32876597502016

 i can much more easily believe <title> bingley s being imposed on than that <title> wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night 	4.926461415325042

 names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony 	7.0831229554100785

 if it be not so let <title> darcy contradict it 	8.126034141222782

 besides there was truth in his looks 	17.267662231717235

 it is difficult indeed it is distressing 	9.883806512373614

 one does not know what to think 	6.823180903683155

 i beg your pardon 	6.822828119474528

 one knows exactly what to think 	7.704002018606607

 but jane could think with certainty on only one point that <title> bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public 	5.04870594688354

 the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking 	6.109522181749654

 <title> bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday 	5.543276299340165

 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation 	3.2695795820559144

 to the rest of the family they paid little attention 	5.05380080784481

 avoiding <title> bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others 	7.994212651353772

 they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from <title> bennet s civilities 	3.231343056737686

 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 	7.658557032467806

 <title> bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from <title> bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card 	5.1924649586332

 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother 	7.663152094385994

 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with <title> wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball 	3.7024520432450925

 and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it 	4.445448110764445

 i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements 	4.007398645274889

 society has claims on us all 	5.881159579038102

 and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body 	2.83703305020819

 elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to <title> collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept <title> bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement 	4.464345788934099

 i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency 	3.612844439685119

 elizabeth felt herself completely taken in 	5.90427613938398

 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have <title> collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed 	3.780171812191735

 there was no help for it however 	6.670955079346494

 <title> wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and <title> collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could 	3.753530789792946

 she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more 	6.085056729716753

 it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors 	3.3806672761677237

 the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity 	3.1764718923394306

 and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her  	5.698306311135885

 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply 	5.772074577152438

 <title> collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him 	5.1817768080480215

 if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once 	5.733280090519886

 no aunt no officers no news could be sought after 	3.7072812191982596

 the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy 	2.9177114823367747

 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with <title> wickham 	3.909218724360785

 and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia 	3.319525087924858

 chapter xviii 	59.55252275142669

 till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for <title> wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her 	3.787563598764854

 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her 	3.814077230642481

 she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 	5.197909353060957

 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for <title> darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers 	5.058773861585148

 and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend <title> denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned 	4.316948945740066

 this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make 	4.070713098131667

 attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham 	4.427525498517657

 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to <title> bingley whose blind partiality provoked her 	4.85867951489239

 but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour 	8.826661369242428

 and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits 	5.405184079818131

 and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice 	5.465358114925636

 the two first dances however brought a return of distress 	3.1980416616168803

 they were dances of mortification 	7.82737901106737

 <title> collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give 	3.0424632192000987

 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy 	10.217175776618182

 she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked 	6.181456484751417

 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by <title> darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him 	5.298373152309471

 he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind 	5.083856153238939

 charlotte tried to console her 	12.53945597462403

 i dare say you will find him very agreeable 	6.264532147510266

 heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil 	5.831382602484193

 when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 	3.434416179012028

 they stood for some time without speaking a word 	4.5058677537284275

 and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it 	5.53519967613752

 till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance 	4.839403157193557

 he replied and was again silent 	13.725573927547309

 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now <title> darcy 	4.319464066154841

 i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples 	6.446221452028118

 he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 	7.750237969238897

 very well 	39.528811506069005

 that reply will do for the present 	9.138256755620137

 perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 	2.4625639422005494

 but now we may be silent 	14.174036664607943

 do you talk by rule then while you are dancing 	5.199671314010487

 one must speak a little you know 	9.769161686719098

 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 	4.9341337610110205

 are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine 	6.8870931948329615

 both replied elizabeth archly 	21.408380408836766

 for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 	7.822184756867144

 we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb 	4.39565327230647

 this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he 	5.581407300757844

 you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 	12.432563895850324

 i must not decide on my own performance 	10.809756451152952

 the effect was immediate 	17.697477271273968

 a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on 	4.283913125995182

 at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said <title> wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain 	3.9056760636852617

 he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life 	6.417269635269346

 darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject 	3.6976420523232303

 at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room 	3.7815817384955976

 but on perceiving <title> darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 	4.074485150564329

 i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir 	5.440870076081824

 such very superior dancing is not often seen 	9.924000078835219

 it is evident that you belong to the first circles 	13.767779058185623

 what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to <title> darcy but let me not interrupt you sir 	3.2078407775932245

 you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me 	3.2376541889825634

 the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy 	5.662945344920978

 but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together 	4.116570418127835

 i do not think we were speaking at all 	4.72335653834467

 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 	5.954410680119904

 we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine 	4.137300233394206

 what think you of books 	9.505815284971273

 said he smiling 	31.38451372055992

 books oh no 	24.965604399904876

 i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings 	5.234970254878981

 i am sorry you think so 	8.102017848119369

 we may compare our different opinions 	5.280582325924847

 no i cannot talk of books in a ball room 	7.519619172519424

 my head is always full of something else 	6.455258727586044

 the present always occupies you in such scenes does it 	5.8246978602595805

 said he with a look of doubt 	7.266571458096041

 you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created  	8.403907092182195

 i am said he with a firm voice 	9.475028348128397

 and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice 	7.233284457846103

 it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first 	3.9516887437430217

 may i ask to what these questions tend 	5.0723882567228245

 merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity 	6.442764335748083

 i am trying to make it out 	9.116932134762967

 and what is your success 	12.004480810797793

 she shook her head 	10.287385979696008

 i do not get on at all 	5.337954570154213

 i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 	4.434039927435104

 and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either 	3.7950600356644486

 but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity 	5.97731867998071

 she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence 	6.85201520477847

 on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another 	3.220225949347604

 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions 	4.30899832620696

 and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late <title> darcy s steward 	4.378737660567138

 let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions 	5.52150568529255

 for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated <title> darcy in a most infamous manner 	5.730067132674571

 i do not know the particulars but i know very well that <title> darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 	5.7552105157825455

 his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it 	6.424770706619404

 i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt 	4.635036562107351

 but really considering his descent one could not expect much better 	5.9606408247536375

 his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily 	6.741561428992775

 for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of <title> darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself 	4.741669163777576

 i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer 	5.068061216824277

 excuse my interference 	34.612290081785915

 insolent girl said elizabeth to herself 	11.970890926395882

 you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this 	5.576592393816561

 she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley 	6.640681527140138

 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening 	3.8181883264080776

 elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness 	4.307088553552536

 i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about <title> wickham 	5.041335390747192

 but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person 	5.7951188635565165

 no replied jane i have not forgotten him 	9.397620655542989

 but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you 	5.439074435532871

 <title> bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended <title> darcy 	5.25939609173721

 but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that <title> wickham has deserved much less attention from <title> darcy than he has received 	6.10452515449162

 and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s <title> wickham is by no means a respectable young man 	4.972360949734344

 i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose <title> darcy s regard 	4.278309811193127

 <title> bingley does not know <title> wickham himself 	13.783467837688312

 he never saw him till the other morning at meryton 	11.722981997892685

 this account then is what he has received from <title> darcy 	5.7015524325547435

 i am perfectly satisfied 	10.951221685090687

 he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from <title> darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only 	5.992693492511488

 i have not a doubt of <title> bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly 	6.888003327491724

 but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 	4.144600659210728

 <title> bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 	4.553957607187977

 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it 	3.465081246332682

 on their being joined by <title> bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas 	6.35628116146356

 i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness 	5.827804108177018

 i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine 	4.411948711362627

 how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 	3.6282255798698775

 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 	5.197650673679043

 you are not going to introduce yourself to <title> darcy 	7.330515387207692

 indeed i am 	13.056512373850758

 i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 	3.819220851214391

 i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew  	13.393992340166276

 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night 	5.360738068151198

 elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme 	6.310340239474021

 assuring him that <title> darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt 	4.233838481391317

 that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to <title> darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance 	4.681509716188832

 <title> collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy 	3.725291482055162

 for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained 	4.031154395061623

 you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 	4.395165440744476

 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself 	2.8893687926671805

 and with a low bow he left her to attack <title> darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident 	4.165221922258044

 it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man 	6.295818236396392

 <title> darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last <title> collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility 	4.630811450370837

 <title> collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and <title> darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way 	4.530090246911267

 <title> collins then returned to elizabeth 	10.464778312950857

 i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception 	5.646831221190854

 <title> darcy seemed much pleased with the attention 	9.242843252517504

 he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily 	4.713531283619064

 upon the whole i am much pleased with him 	10.927547691058336

 as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and <title> bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 	4.147849090765363

 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow 	5.392274357513413

 and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters 	3.9620141462363683

 her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much 	3.4701150923514166

 when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other 	3.414814418394888

 and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to <title> bingley 	4.628650843940444

 it was an animating subject and <title> bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match 	4.186583388707804

 it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men 	4.857667763357459

 and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked 	6.16889862547547

 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette 	4.452290019920942

 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 	3.4752953503476283

 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper 	3.754502378535183

 for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by <title> darcy who sat opposite to them 	6.846801275923663

 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 	7.912142065164761

 what is <title> darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him 	8.996030036299642

 i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear 	5.546431065152614

 for heaven s sake madam speak lower 	4.983876516143273

 what advantage can it be to you to offend <title> darcy 	6.090675922514773

 you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 	6.158191861583694

 nothing that she could say however had any influence 	12.376571403408228

 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation 	3.3679572536009657

 she could not help frequently glancing her eye at <title> darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded 	4.448217931931785

 for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her 	6.927186128366193

 the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity 	4.417260822185894

 at length however <title> bennet had no more to say 	6.638035956682972

 and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 	4.151887981491768

 elizabeth now began to revive 	12.394056136362085

 but not long was the interval of tranquillity 	9.717629874846066

 for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company 	3.844754969954216

 by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain 	3.6568345209037756

 mary would not understand them 	17.870542703004364

 such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song 	6.385963211147368

 elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations 	7.56320566927402

 and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close 	3.9277723718960815

 for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another 	4.494392793011864

 mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display 	5.077492117837816

 her voice was weak and her manner affected 	9.060025392274119

 elizabeth was in agonies 	25.393695258969522

 she looked at jane to see how she bore it 	7.898247186509744

 but jane was very composedly talking to bingley 	7.8755530239459155

 she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave 	3.6401912106804124

 she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night 	3.641606928798559

 you have delighted us long enough 	6.047900933087399

 let the other young ladies have time to exhibit 	10.785227604631364

 mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted 	5.893042610354363

 and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good 	5.204931950558229

 if i said <title> collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air 	5.247130637520594

 i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to 	4.494335784169939

 the rector of a parish has much to do 	6.231419774732389

 in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 	4.942086147465351

 he must write his own sermons 	13.216975516711218

 and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible 	4.6959968097022

 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment 	3.3841165372242

 i cannot acquit him of that duty 	10.04708788782798

 and with a bow to <title> darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room 	4.4539956572617685

 many stared 	86.8147124672468

 many smiled 	86.8147124672468

 to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success 	4.476445844378379

 and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 	6.346496857625537

 that his two sisters and <title> darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable 	4.82940539901983

 the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 	6.743517183890099

 she was teazed by <title> collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others 	6.151893627925922

 he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it 	8.47786116455682

 there was no arguing upon such a project 	7.773065250292054

 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged <title> collins s conversation to herself 	3.6183289652390345

 she was at least free from the offence of <title> darcy s farther notice 	6.36425758536143

 though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak 	4.642102124419477

 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to <title> wickham and rejoiced in it 	6.48758779267081

 they repulsed every attempt of <title> bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of <title> collins who was complimenting <title> bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests 	4.41581707214435

 <title> bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene 	3.6427764928947437

 <title> bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other 	4.841446260489002

 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either <title> hurst or miss bingley 	2.956428590026421

 and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn 	4.304676191848296

 when at length they arose to take leave <title> bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn 	4.685896561136881

 and addressed herself particularly to <title> bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation 	4.428506526510637

 bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time 	4.08948222118083

 <title> bennet was perfectly satisfied 	10.741078333870407

 and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months 	3.4719719005347436

 of having another daughter married to <title> collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure 	4.856205548974238

 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children 	13.074929334681398

 and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by <title> bingley and netherfield 	4.868372931722781

 the next day opened a new scene at longbourn 	4.021501020666471

 <title> collins made his declaration in form 	5.2985674732582755

 having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business 	4.102481887701851

 on finding <title> bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning 	4.7894103786832165

 before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise <title> bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly 	5.122973658437299

 i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection 	4.519705362838643

 come kitty i want you up stairs 	4.818936742463808

 and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma am do not go 	4.458279250306832

 i beg you will not go 	11.838889968109532

 <title> collins must excuse me 	9.519269119756489

 he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear 	7.651165928581754

 no no nonsense lizzy 	10.481781044548947

 i desire you will stay where you are 	4.8774544822121335

 and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing <title> collins 	2.621318223899105

 elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 	3.67598765616535

 you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness 	4.956331141341675

 but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address 	6.455835265168898

 my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 	10.858077504901221

 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life 	6.400095647282846

 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did 	3.665067984964856

 secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness 	6.532171960800557

 and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness 	4.531996172909805

 twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject 	4.801952568444306

 and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while <title> jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said <title> collins you must marry 	3.697555095519269

 a clergyman like you must marry 	10.615115772723719

 chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake 	4.767563565029122

 and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way 	3.848419155332187

 this is my advice 	17.11465692689775

 find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her 	8.11610001529046

 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe 	6.872001073457819

 and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 	4.0827392095911055

 it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women 	3.8399512270919596

 but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years 	3.288887200908177

 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 	7.001471331643941

 to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with 	5.125872142536074

 and that one thousand pounds in the <number> per cents 	8.53406508980113

 which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to 	6.558930807613375

 on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent 	6.9168312044726505

 and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married 	2.9876902455259033

 it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 	5.737162659753417

 you forget that i have made no answer 	10.133615421467095

 accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 	10.561038470179023

 i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them 	6.429706113432749

 i am not now to learn replied <title> collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour 	4.464060914917207

 and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time 	2.6794926125824845

 i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 	4.442923947383372

 i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time 	3.923484730884345

 i am perfectly serious in my refusal 	8.048966733182398

 nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation 	5.626902849994518

 were it certain that lady catherine would think so said <title> collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 	6.062978186903885

 and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications 	5.561139902193874

 indeed <title> collins all praise of me will be unnecessary 	10.487503901495971

 you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 	3.289539032056497

 i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 	3.4873501174901596

 this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled 	4.931047583436717

 and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not <title> collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me 	5.593037932857866

 though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character 	4.784661970921613

 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one 	4.404091778407737

 you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course 	3.491667104526699

 my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable 	3.6470167894065306

 my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour 	4.625894257266925

 and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you 	3.79183318547489

 your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications 	3.8311117962809025

 as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females 	5.1781362300898754

 i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man 	3.365794784131098

 i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible 	5.115028705091008

 my feelings in every respect forbid it 	6.938955335394226

 can i speak plainer 	21.476075829273896

 do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart 	4.087873424734788

 you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry 	3.6895404720664207

 and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable 	4.359783616560646

 determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female 	3.7533582550590205

 chapter xx 	103.29264366621743

 <title> collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love 	7.922509055624215

 for <title> bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 	3.9178225583865887

 but depend upon it <title> collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason 	4.871970023578441

 i will speak to her about it myself directly 	8.576137961986582

 she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest 	5.257192160519645

 but i will make her know it 	10.53699453516464

 pardon me for interrupting you madam cried <title> collins 	4.656803179708555

 if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity 	3.5980103169378967

 sir you quite misunderstand me said <title> bennet alarmed 	7.328455008875176

 lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these 	4.329308441615588

 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived 	7.238909086572512

 she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh <title> bennet you are wanted immediately 	5.997191228763924

 you must come and make lizzy marry <title> collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her  	5.324224477212476

 <title> bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 	4.928708359590236

 i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech 	4.253788047707893

 of what are you talking 	14.762790621503507

 of <title> collins and lizzy 	17.697327708095198

 lizzy declares she will not have <title> collins and <title> collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy 	9.279417586608872

 and what am i to do on the occasion 	7.248687313907826

 it seems an hopeless business 	7.522324208354507

 speak to lizzy about it yourself 	13.826377604575534

 tell her that you insist upon her marrying him 	10.144926773393792

 let her be called down 	10.348008848201557

 she shall hear my opinion 	10.01595880584329

 <title> bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 	7.8210019863723375

 come here child cried her father as she appeared 	11.230148895481115

 i have sent for you on an affair of importance 	5.226755807156301

 i understand that <title> collins has made you an offer of marriage 	6.14920233746795

 is it true 	25.826630767245554

 elizabeth replied that it was 	10.865979208935267

 very well and this offer of marriage you have refused 	7.4473829773363365

 i have sir 	21.33947124398617

 very well 	39.528811506069005

 we now come to the point 	13.732791519025726

 your mother insists upon your accepting it 	4.430705079589404

 is not it so <title> bennet 	9.472141787757685

 an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth 	4.756411848898107

 from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents 	9.230124532968627

 your mother will never see you again if you do not marry <title> collins and i will never see you again if you do  	5.258363740290152

 elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning 	6.317347831955128

 but <title> bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed 	5.099353235759955

 what do you mean <title> bennet by talking in this way 	5.019047394278119

 you promised me to insist upon her marrying him 	5.661477115646207

 my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request 	6.512654537670665

 first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion 	10.602857849366938

 and secondly of my room 	16.56534301458117

 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 	6.149102821398666

 she talked to elizabeth again and again 	7.981251191302768

 coaxed and threatened her by turns 	6.295270183830946

 she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering 	5.590182394526153

 though her manner varied however her determination never did 	3.8154442760369616

 <title> collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed 	2.981528183308522

 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him 	5.039145505315332

 his regard for her was quite imaginary 	17.24096540003545

 and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret 	5.118675992246045

 while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them 	6.877052223538784

 <title> collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him 	6.474974699809519

 charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where <title> bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family 	4.361802891637096

 pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves 	3.720249100084287

 aye there she comes continued <title> bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way 	3.727529116522194

 but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 	3.8438449148636376

 i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you 	5.972176563791048

 i have done with you from this very day 	10.346043897919579

 i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word 	6.728731610059245

 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children 	5.90992584891943

 not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body 	5.209504400420021

 nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so 	9.56625536048154

 those who do not complain are never pitied 	8.226365099350943

 her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation 	2.503377832248929

 she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by <title> collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let <title> collins and me have a little conversation together 	4.846788639884162

 elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could 	4.175923923219562

 and charlotte detained first by the civility of <title> collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 	4.802279430117643

 in a doleful voice <title> bennet thus began the projected conversation 	5.922076306618399

 oh <title> collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point 	4.962289309117664

 far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter 	2.8654850832668872

 resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all 	4.584744512266491

 and i trust i am resigned 	20.11322403595638

 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand 	4.121500400883028

 for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation 	3.1505373267492485

 you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and <title> bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf 	3.065434028420093

 my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own 	3.2357225852869638

 but we are all liable to error 	7.088016559387351

 i have certainly meant well through the whole affair 	6.817825817227903

 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise 	4.121454715702765

 chapter xxi 	103.29264366621743

 the discussion of <title> collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother 	4.00805065449152

 as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence 	2.645161338751411

 he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend 	5.306928884950044

 the morrow produced no abatement of <title> bennet s ill humour or ill health 	4.093205927851008

 <title> collins was also in the same state of angry pride 	7.282669986787206

 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 	4.857744943760541

 he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay 	6.064532425929112

 after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if <title> wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball 	4.482426625533581

 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over 	3.714756646355796

 to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed 	8.087632043002804

 i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet <title> darcy 	5.064462947665296

 that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 	6.183758286623237

 she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her 	4.264579937639153

 his accompanying them was a double advantage 	7.46473657317165

 she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 	6.049500042076471

 soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet 	6.019390051741914

 it came from netherfield and was opened immediately 	8.148335873985316

 jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation 	4.707732135939221

 but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham 	3.3666071651072857

 and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs 	3.475291016921328

 when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley 	4.507841262477826

 what it contains has surprised me a good deal 	5.130494900971262

 the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town 	4.494919422302394

 and without any intention of coming back again 	6.45536223216029

 you shall hear what she says 	13.270928860597536

 the next was in these words 	11.993868393120197

 i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend 	3.8323193492862933

 but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 	3.600519978252046

 i depend on you for that 	13.405223735175811

 to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust 	3.8238408378145494

 and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament 	4.66456462189251

 it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent <title> bingley s being there 	4.264005785946229

 and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his 	6.016208595271572

 it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country 	4.8233248162881335

 but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters 	3.9298840851355648

 <title> bingley will not be detained in london by them 	6.0268106087627125

 caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter 	4.311588770734659

 i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel 	3.7870782221757975

 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter 	6.8048411401719555

 i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair 	6.374883311025886

 i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you 	3.989880664156706

 it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter 	4.04770489975446

 it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should  	6.696441515908916

 why will you think so 	12.014565446422866

 it must be his own doing 	18.638458932166905

 he is his own master 	20.17410373256221

 but you do not know all  	11.20123734981048

 i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me 	3.3620317033307763

 i will have no reserves from you  	8.815581524496428

 <title> darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again 	5.301530127054695

 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments 	3.7410565432325806

 and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 	3.4202815783443046

 my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart 	3.616019052176497

 what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy 	7.0444620710680805

 said jane as she finished it 	13.597657800346857

 is it not clear enough 	10.664733805946264

 does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister 	3.874902785679961

 that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard 	5.321874664110735

 will you hear it 	11.457329020659557

 most willingly 	99.99855183286036

 you shall have it in few words 	10.87504971752208

 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy 	5.7678243946747525

 she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 	6.103306824347753

 jane shook her head 	9.698932953209175

 indeed jane you ought to believe me 	11.113585377608326

 no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection 	3.592899353102148

 miss bingley i am sure cannot 	14.876049939431816

 she is not such a simpleton 	17.457858884522814

 could she have seen half as much love in <title> darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes 	6.902594384483092

 but the case is this 	12.575105075301545

 we are not rich enough or grand enough for them 	4.2451689900337435

 and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second 	4.528506798082262

 in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way 	6.478816893258118

 but i know the foundation is unjust 	11.2166882078297

 and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself 	9.20834871216544

 that is right 	25.931972482987053

 believe her to be deceived by all means 	10.3575536401514

 you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer 	4.274180773459111

 but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere 	3.3065896616215342

 you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him 	4.107406284226686

 how can you talk so 	5.816264550547728

 said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate 	5.294130246287578

 i did not think you would 	11.679883344243585

 and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion 	5.2342664184426075

 but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required 	3.6089812869149593

 a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 	3.804415429411604

 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect 	4.678918747182366

 jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart 	4.737411049416196

 they agreed that <title> bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct 	7.428075484603798

 but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together 	3.633087180555559

 after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that <title> bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses 	5.394707779220652

 chapter xxii 	103.29264366621743

 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to <title> collins 	4.67215709587043

 it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express 	8.808227915900233

 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 	7.668295895891835

 this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of 	4.479881087679753

 its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of <title> collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself 	4.053045503084461

 such was miss lucas s scheme 	8.312564601226965

 but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet 	3.9405666879053776

 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise 	4.345206848473342

 for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday 	3.819950758519067

 his reception however was of the most flattering kind 	11.147184833183099

 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane 	4.680339731171297

 but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there 	5.6038924596649045

 and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men 	5.280438732508073

 and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness 	5.345355144682681

 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance 	3.4742529586393243

 and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained 	3.675555996603116

 and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity 	8.381464374919828

 <title> collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune 	3.4893542324012197

 and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair 	4.079168729072443

 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer <title> bennet was likely to live 	3.91961479860936

 and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever <title> collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st 	4.248609127199637

 james <initial> the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 	4.871493723959602

 the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done 	3.539417077684943

 her reflections were in general satisfactory 	12.47648445261242

 <title> collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable 	5.4393433708208745

 his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary 	7.709278731427325

 but still he would be her husband 	11.973243359654825

 without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object 	3.5892301033503715

 it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want 	2.450844765891565

 this preservative she had now obtained 	13.760052072353105

 and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it 	3.975867684517116

 the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 	4.6406467001400005

 elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her 	4.030680110892205

 and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation 	6.3424539203045

 she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged <title> collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family 	4.892439121906043

 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty 	4.002345867330352

 for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love 	3.0962910012950364

 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night 	4.624438402518275

 and <title> bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them 	4.391266195371879

 my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive 	4.598832027346735

 and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible 	7.476317930504729

 and <title> bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir 	3.177555679648135

 you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness 	2.507399868034605

 my dear sir replied <title> collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence 	4.175971600608145

 you cannot be too much on your guard 	7.171409947597846

 risk any thing rather than her displeasure 	11.706348285165557

 and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 	4.036329600825609

 and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire 	4.736481674166986

 as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth 	2.919343441743377

 with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew 	5.993156374326519

 all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return 	5.701072526841004

 <title> bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 	5.274642087677254

 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others 	5.874826213110813

 there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion 	3.6743192312117254

 but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away 	5.043182102270134

 miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 	5.323505696266624

 the possibility of <title> collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two 	5.372166539819039

 but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to <title> collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach 	3.097955147811875

 though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza 	4.821014372209253

 do you think it incredible that <title> collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you 	5.618729812900674

 i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as <title> collins was wishing to marry you 	4.853885549755162

 i am not romantic you know 	5.011339594542043

 i never was 	28.546728834979216

 i ask only a comfortable home 	10.57047194890272

 and considering <title> collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state 	3.682787206493657

 elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly 	10.113491121410796

 and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family 	4.651723459879804

 charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 	5.770063434124376

 the strangeness of <title> collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted 	3.559755248220344

 she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage 	3.9438312682304235

 charlotte the wife of <title> collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 	4.838254948549705

 chapter xxiii 	103.29264366621743

 with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous 	3.973616457626035

 for <title> bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story 	3.6267026252902284

 nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment 	4.471413848001678

 but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all 	3.68193556881115

 and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy 	7.2693768983140625

 and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of <title> collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london 	5.34497526372857

 <title> bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained 	5.71196381535941

 but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent 	4.34321073944406

 in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter 	4.488519799649242

 secondly she was very sure that <title> collins had been taken in 	11.385637133844543

 and fourthly that the match might be broken off 	10.009177482038178

 two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole 	4.695768526613936

 one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief 	13.436234544303376

 and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all 	6.067065006237734

 and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day 	3.3626080087323262

 nothing could console and nothing appease her 	5.249899621419428

 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 	3.9513531081230475

 <title> bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort 	5.20196415061763

 for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match 	4.479772533531961

 but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness 	7.331461640141768

 nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 	5.749476785815217

 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for <title> collins was only a clergyman 	5.8828642204784

 and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton 	4.115020485148773

 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on <title> bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married 	4.234747583267866

 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject 	3.9599553250485346

 and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again 	4.669508220277887

 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return 	3.180174486542872

 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 	4.967766692002096

 the promised letter of thanks from <title> collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted 	4.196702225996978

 after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight 	3.914692032939369

 for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 	4.021949749726294

 <title> collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to <title> bennet 	4.524507737175913

 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband 	7.649616061845098

 it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome 	4.360065142661149

 she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 	4.87829493098171

 such were the gentle murmurs of <title> bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of <title> bingley s continued absence 	5.800403323218609

 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 	3.6898826090119923

 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter 	4.773838004954295

 a report which highly incensed <title> bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood 	5.1098660504138556

 even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away 	5.175019202101284

 unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring 	5.140927310421651

 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment 	6.161113401000921

 as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s 	3.3612357043742684

 but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to 	4.768500082576667

 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used 	4.099993082797886

 it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity 	2.9967620050273567

 <title> collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction 	4.539903251071998

 he was too happy however to need much attention 	5.708625494777539

 and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company 	6.327661668932015

 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 	5.411595422479426

 <title> bennet was really in a most pitiable state 	8.759427218703962

 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of 	3.8177551425063214

 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her 	7.7384571854428605

 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 	5.1510309169324735

 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession 	5.721259751986452

 and whenever she spoke in a low voice to <title> collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as <title> bennet were dead 	5.694785837205088

 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 	8.72911354261412

 indeed <title> bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts 	5.177557296326495

 let us hope for better things 	5.267671055245982

 let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor 	9.69588803198244

 if it was not for the entail i should not mind it 	8.653454826782342

 what should not you mind 	18.054889720857748

 i should not mind any thing at all 	7.8144380329036505

 let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility 	6.262995652807858

 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand 	4.057218996310884

 and all for the sake of <title> collins too why should he have it more than anybody else 	6.1955348899104195

 i leave it to yourself to determine said <title> bennet 	6.41961817257522

 end of vol 	36.978250671453964

 <initial> illustration a vicarage house 	6.393676063893187

 pride and prejudice a novel 	5.98736138453866

 in three volumes 	12.855734893179736

 by the author of sense and sensibility 	4.8970222571520985

 london printed for <initial> egerton military library whitehall 	2.9121314485964773

 pride & prejudice 	21.544138901048637

 the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country 	3.919421354689192

 hope was over entirely over 	13.612157322671091

 and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort 	4.536770777045943

 miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it 	4.949795672964972

 her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 	3.7173271302142608

 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of <title> darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 	4.381982000784445

 elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation 	5.386453197903658

 her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others 	4.392213965302955

 to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit 	4.6678717932722025

 that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done 	8.996222454977763

 and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 	4.352961646045506

 it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing 	5.028692208369974

 she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference 	3.477001388135882

 whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation 	5.213635298006141

 whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded 	4.964152639318137

 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth 	4.829810829287339

 but at last on <title> bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself 	3.5362845104038043

 she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him 	5.432490656303112

 but i will not repine 	11.498963262574058

 it cannot last long 	13.664390116192877

 he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before 	6.388466306355329

 elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing 	3.999158590724838

 you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring 	4.644077301406856

 indeed you have no reason 	13.659981887920168

 he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all 	6.097113052266222

 i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with 	4.3691698052456465

 i shall certainly try to get the better 	5.6619848393270855

 with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself 	4.6470196621341024

 my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good 	5.199554172163345

 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic 	4.809588261890244

 i do not know what to say to you 	4.098837699508468

 i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve 	7.095735384782875

 miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection 	3.0831649044506464

 nay said elizabeth this is not fair 	12.318754553661398

 you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body 	7.377754993991107

 i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it 	5.69815599279748

 do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will 	4.980132526094457

 you need not 	12.973909492886254

 the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it 	6.160184880020964

 and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense 	5.606384965524435

 i have met with two instances lately 	6.945280499436049

 one i will not mention 	21.792076627843574

 it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these 	5.330913677147625

 they will ruin your happiness 	6.668898140924355

 you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper 	4.215911785462796

 consider <title> collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character 	5.338864174103219

 remember that she is one of a large family 	27.957715530878925

 that as to fortune it is a most eligible match 	8.08166701205159

 and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 	4.800581028833771

 to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this 	5.497797273479278

 for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart 	6.549754864224965

 my dear jane <title> collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man 	4.672301146947209

 and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking 	5.075713650735224

 you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas 	6.435943909816014

 you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness 	2.596007951019763

 i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together 	4.424199463433914

 but enough of this 	16.47392492329167

 you mentioned two instances 	10.388647783707652

 i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk 	3.582701643371277

 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 	4.05434595391708

 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect 	5.534615572122582

 it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us 	3.8646821976821304

 women fancy admiration means more than it does 	7.331960645954911

 if it is designedly done they cannot be justified 	7.419051326181854

 but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 	5.073738988988284

 i am far from attributing any part of <title> bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth 	4.127414475976601

 but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery 	5.012521753164234

 thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business 	5.11614455701215

 and do you impute it to either of those 	8.918389480543711

 to the last 	30.01951189800113

 but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 	5.431351357228568

 yes in conjunction with his friend 	5.7671597212983166

 why should they try to influence him 	5.563710287532826

 they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence 	3.1087344152548897

 they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride 	4.348363351040427

 beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane 	6.453717399201869

 but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing 	6.639012201552486

 they have known her much longer than they have known me 	5.160889779531365

 but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother <initial> what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable 	3.4584235007829625

 if he were so they could not succeed 	10.715536454035194

 by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy 	3.6724157594442004

 i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 	5.0224794749432276

 let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood 	8.620805107392655

 and from this time <title> bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 	4.7460042633878725

 <title> bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 	4.200100537331341

 her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more 	4.735152178211042

 <title> bennet treated the matter differently 	8.706792887522441

 so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find 	5.098316621444269

 i congratulate her 	37.42544304170275

 next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then 	6.162629283051696

 when is your turn to come 	6.41234621357363

 you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane 	7.052791872422529

 now is your time 	19.44471695969175

 here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country 	4.4419167891157105

 he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably 	4.191559274640622

 thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 	4.51028860909259

 we must not all expect jane s good fortune 	7.354410586029829

 true said <title> bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it 	4.776862826878275

 <title> wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family 	3.2880243125874795

 they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve 	6.50104255660205

 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on <title> darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed 	5.701567200503153

 and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked <title> darcy before they had known any thing of the matter 	6.7538273541314

 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire 	5.734114776649918

 her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else <title> darcy was condemned as the worst of men 	2.3463638121867203

 chapter ii 	44.72575127815273

 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity <title> collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday 	3.8423875359285025

 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before 	6.810472670991218

 wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks 	3.532110509792855

 on the following monday <title> bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn 	4.812850189080599

 <title> gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education 	5.49955815145965

 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable 	4.784727656226453

 <title> gardiner who was several years younger than <title> bennet and <title> philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces 	5.028714786808028

 between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard 	5.165340768182386

 they had frequently been staying with her in town 	7.6160732497256705

 the first part of <title> gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions 	4.59450980211869

 when this was done she had a less active part to play 	6.089039307865693

 it became her turn to listen 	10.426615387391807

 <title> bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of 	3.477541583028805

 they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister 	3.9881581093779213

 two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it 	8.08599406037349

 i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got <title> bingley if she could 	5.5621221935521055

 but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been <title> collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness 	5.147090857620592

 he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him 	8.574594859619912

 the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever 	6.3279768723785965

 the lucases are very artful people indeed sister 	4.954445177251608

 they are all for what they can get 	9.955780923155551

 i am sorry to say it of them but so it is 	6.39421853865339

 it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else 	4.227691920193197

 however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves 	4.748510679527503

 <title> gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation 	5.775155432117928

 when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject 	4.210152900048105

 it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she 	5.776075362144117

 i am sorry it went off 	5.380412702810165

 an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us  	5.603439871219959

 we do not suffer by accident  	9.514197803030488

 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before 	3.869041755243254

 but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea 	3.8881003539441905

 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment 	5.031657445653523

 pray how violent was <title> bingley s love 	6.972175931135052

 i never saw a more promising inclination 	5.67784343216783

 he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her 	2.8706107608482676

 every time they met it was more decided and remarkable 	6.231404574960431

 at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer 	4.13679241683675

 could there be finer symptoms 	7.796955570221463

 is not general incivility the very essence of love 	5.527290901008371

 poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately 	6.623689518507279

 it had better have happened to you lizzy 	9.564065302756035

 you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 	10.214802111567554

 but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us 	7.131661561240018

 change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything 	4.954940051255509

 elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence 	5.039194502749959

 i hope added <title> gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her 	4.9008097954940215

 we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her 	3.533643846934482

 and that is quite impossible 	26.462354988661055

 for he is now in the custody of his friend and <title> darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it 	6.404660753030602

 <title> darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it 	3.6260297795547896

 and depend upon it <title> bingley never stirs without him 	5.008893930690674

 so much the better 	10.597269234746989

 i hope they will not meet at all 	7.827603033206775

 but does not jane correspond with the sister 	10.889163346688456

 she will not be able to help calling 	7.2417771989162425

 she will drop the acquaintance entirely 	7.305486362639215

 it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions 	4.82740107320027

 and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him 	5.038504428639825

 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn 	5.247336187705402

 and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement 	6.767208323628147

 <title> bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 	4.7911040922655594

 when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers <title> wickham was sure to be one 	6.021541870160211

 and on these occasions <title> gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both 	3.311593901663967

 without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy 	6.23040804590392

 and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 	4.877759937032091

 to <title> gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers 	5.359828491510796

 they had therefore many acquaintance in common 	5.728982752825777

 and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring 	4.684565714512012

 <title> gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late <title> darcy by character perfectly well 	4.0298080011893065

 here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse 	5.45295488509366

 and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly 	7.1394103618424305

 seriously i would have you be on your guard 	16.57858047637143

 do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent 	4.270226452689496

 i have nothing to say against him  	7.2115654181223

 he is a most interesting young man 	6.562654040682571

 and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better 	8.16442200410683

 but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you 	5.734746438868871

 you have sense and we all expect you to use it 	6.874027625435921

 your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure 	5.176693036393141

 you must not disappoint your father 	6.006908189294818

 my dear aunt this is being serious indeed 	5.186967542311074

 yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise 	12.594216159457241

 well then you need not be under any alarm 	5.916912626659368

 i will take care of myself and of <title> wickham too 	9.344487383393846

 elizabeth you are not serious now 	11.949365509894545

 i beg your pardon 	6.822828119474528

 i will try again 	11.135486598481995

 at present i am not in love with <title> wickham 	9.275630343240595

 no i certainly am not 	7.837596692343998

 but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not 	4.605112982578928

 oh that abominable <title> darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour 	6.224792975701418

 and i should be miserable to forfeit it 	6.092060315748932

 my father however is partial to <title> wickham 	6.258531531018578

 in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy 	7.814227728599217

 but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist 	3.3891492312525573

 all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry 	6.872984055790766

 i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object 	4.960493017443637

 when i am in company with him i will not be wishing 	8.525733125209289

 in short i will do my best 	11.186809813013792

 perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often 	7.270904491554996

 as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile 	10.530496077550344

 but do not imagine that he is always here so often 	8.899502082032939

 you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends 	5.691304044733866

 but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest 	7.329183923737628

 and now i hope you are satisfied 	13.992554644715979

 her aunt assured her that she was 	7.039437698470127

 <title> collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane 	6.080490329928919

 but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to <title> bennet 	5.821380420505797

 his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy 	5.80246374624954

 thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit 	6.68163792364767

 and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room 	3.113693359540046

 as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza 	5.096727301903428

 and i have another favour to ask 	7.048715605077207

 will you come and see me 	9.39865241224825

 we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire 	7.7878426734722135

 promise me therefore to come to hunsford 	7.941839608998106

 elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit 	6.206560864482531

 my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party 	6.66932438568601

 the wedding took place 	11.151826864615296

 the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual 	4.960764850217583

 elizabeth soon heard from her friend 	10.403668315591876

 and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been 	4.129037595189783

 that it should be equally unreserved was impossible 	8.487732590321837

 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was 	4.884147328696256

 charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness 	6.372443831851202

 there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be 	5.198536369318424

 though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen 	4.855464378656249

 she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise 	3.602798834214121

 the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging 	5.870038141768535

 it was <title> collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened 	5.572894906257721

 and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest 	6.778605502181261

 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london 	4.761608248629833

 and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys 	7.898860562929022

 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is 	4.556755761463673

 jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline 	4.864858315623358

 she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost 	4.372022815162582

 my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street 	5.2723247433829865

 she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley 	5.890537550396179

 i was right therefore 	14.42537719887591

 my last letter had never reached her 	9.111348799389528

 he was well but so much engaged with <title> darcy that they scarcely ever saw him 	7.6722309713449315

 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner 	8.123920384908836

 i wish i could see her 	7.626973427118604

 my visit was not long as caroline and <title> hurst were going out 	8.050699446644895

 i dare say i shall soon see them here 	4.960859174853875

 elizabeth shook her head over this letter 	5.0494264875709804

 it convinced her that accident only could discover to <title> bingley her sister s being in town 	4.885260643312349

 four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him 	6.790879993898632

 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it 	8.304079577126263

 but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention 	6.171513411759806

 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear 	3.734542126995982

 but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer 	3.879127850563602

 the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt 	6.607728906031973

 my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me 	3.9697219171378997

 but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion 	3.0081464745253093

 i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again 	5.295337363399968

 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday 	7.132708032015626

 when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it 	8.148350856316151

 i pity though i cannot help blaming her 	7.270963232497375

 she was very wrong in singling me out as she did 	5.017977068771429

 i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side 	4.289981646847289

 but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it 	6.2050271487854625

 i need not explain myself farther 	7.688381322005533

 and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable 	4.050305081412648

 i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago 	4.197901510632429

 he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself 	5.484831677624896

 and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy 	5.211692147528669

 i cannot understand it 	8.757526108092302

 if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this 	4.500931439651002

 but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 	4.4550715151275035

 let me hear from you very soon 	4.823758514153197

 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty 	5.126874957542747

 we had better not mention it 	8.859124707209128

 i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford 	3.8330557913271375

 pray go to see them with sir william and maria 	8.966197345863513

 i am sure you will be very comfortable there 	6.637405036873003

 your s & <initial> this letter gave elizabeth some pain 	3.409417181343582

 but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least 	5.197788509494802

 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over 	8.019148644154647

 and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry <title> darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away 	4.592417528872824

 <title> gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information 	4.454809906217846

 and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 	4.331871347193246

 his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else 	3.690882751473279

 her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it 	3.8107182412209344

 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable 	5.288289457596488

 nothing on the contrary could be more natural 	8.53516878184218

 and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy 	3.3012729851632803

 all this was acknowledged to <title> gardiner 	12.13602440183998

 and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love 	4.1941293825567305

 for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil 	2.9470134491415516

 but my feelings are not only cordial towards him  	5.799409073456447

 they are even impartial towards miss king 	3.949388409741322

 i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl 	6.2775422860886945

 there can be no love in all this 	5.0231402523921105

 my watchfulness has been effectual 	13.731068084777482

 and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance 	5.133359389250086

 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 	4.383945822667752

 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do 	4.098519701423186

 they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain 	5.486950223214993

 chapter iv 	44.72575127815273

 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away 	2.3168756551396967

 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford 	15.436970539965385

 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither 	5.024606509568151

 but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 	4.014029800241388

 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of <title> collins 	3.8206941554291705

 there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 	4.993741666181072

 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane 	4.145558462366674

 and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay 	6.169343617447669

 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be 	3.9667112172723407

 the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter 	5.995743656892775

 the farewell between herself and <title> wickham was perfectly friendly 	8.540220178088667

 on his side even more 	11.478375591112806

 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired 	5.805360608572612

 and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard 	4.230236180093512

 and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing 	3.866624442993229

 her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable 	4.901740945365771

 sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise 	3.706592391187306

 elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long 	5.383275296312437

 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood 	7.3860904835430174

 and his civilities were worn out like his information 	3.7767991734012605

 it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon 	3.9215950474802166

 when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever 	4.152149437471967

 on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower 	3.6436361322391395

 all was joy and kindness 	6.980546874522568

 the day passed most pleasantly away 	7.033622209604037

 the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres 	7.5334613675749384

 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 	7.585064712005596

 their first subject was her sister 	8.546515816380538

 and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection 	3.217422829665376

 it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long 	7.217365718706052

 <title> gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance 	4.069030883563195

 <title> gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well 	2.9009927395786907

 but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king 	4.722077706676872

 i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 	6.9450226803435

 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive 	4.980047381138606

 where does discretion end and avarice begin 	4.018334804953786

 last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent 	8.27966972300322

 and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary 	5.842537359414233

 if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think 	4.420880633577549

 she is a very good kind of girl i believe 	4.512037821546076

 i know no harm of her 	6.3701558465867345

 but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune 	3.730581265319466

 no why should he 	13.188457214489238

 if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor 	4.528341467963184

 but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event 	4.417384328309195

 if she does not object to it why should we  	6.600203079189771

 her not objecting does not justify him  	9.071361897744344

 it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling 	3.152536441721497

 well cried elizabeth have it as you choose 	13.20569538849324

 he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish 	12.604786669134434

 no lizzy that is what i do not choose 	12.285044935930737

 i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire 	4.138054144319476

 oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire 	5.953788010525512

 and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better 	5.09837069132936

 i am sick of them all 	7.969677922178564

 thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 	4.324223924573112

 stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all 	4.216300785836853

 take care lizzy 	41.24542093095204

 that speech savours strongly of disappointment 	4.725677649432172

 no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful 	6.555992189538493

 my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour 	2.7492154178244674

 adieu to disappointment and spleen 	7.917922558837253

 what are men to rocks and mountains 	4.542498143661103

 we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen 	4.673592827755818

 let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers 	3.5956681274678037

 chapter <initial> every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth 	3.6688912264605524

 for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight 	6.788342650267061

 when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view 	4.576772863603105

 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side 	3.2559999988779595

 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 	9.051222406001274

 at length the parsonage was discernible 	6.7187431413649685

 <title> collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 	4.5778513781795125

 in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other 	6.478172516548581

 <title> collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received 	5.256549451041236

 she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage 	6.886057439874412

 they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house 	4.414699328471048

 and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment 	3.2907577151377154

 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory 	8.027509319558122

 and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 	4.147568691859438

 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance 	4.431735988535737

 and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion 	5.487815376826419

 when <title> collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte 	3.6383695943009724

 once or twice she could discern a faint blush 	5.686265176703015

 but in general charlotte wisely did not hear 	6.417541056174622

 and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible 	3.6951812281335004

 here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind 	2.1522405895871177

 he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump 	4.487406524199658

 but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 	4.232623479092981

 it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground 	3.1293048998979254

 from his garden <title> collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back 	3.7615423187709105

 and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help 	3.7516786430921636

 it was rather small but well built and convenient 	3.53838298041061

 when <title> collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten 	4.639424501394993

 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 	7.304780792341328

 it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when <title> collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her 	4.464736019332928

 she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over 	4.812923123642029

 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming 	15.695134040362992

 her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us 	3.260021556069906

 i should say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several 	7.089769485219798

 lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour 	5.103765295529023

 very true my dear that is exactly what i say 	7.595101463373278

 she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference 	4.952141396655149

 the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written 	3.152894712911704

 and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 	3.667336308279787

 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of <title> collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings 	3.0039196120997587

 a lively imagination soon settled it all 	5.069840042295878

 about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion 	6.52565620552285

 and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her 	3.0662108416822234

 make haste and come down this moment 	4.374043148511255

 it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate 	5.808330377078779

 and is this all 	19.09624692782282

 cried elizabeth 	33.76519598283851

 the old lady is <title> jenkinson who lives with them 	5.161216931113347

 the other is miss de bourgh 	12.268118845544898

 only look at her 	12.373666497587205

 she is quite a little creature 	15.060508168975225

 who would have thought she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind 	4.750222073278004

 why does she not come in 	7.481330180125996

 oh charlotte says she hardly ever does 	4.489101452744506

 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in 	4.292035379130686

 i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas 	7.008726000407949

 she looks sickly and cross 	6.454223908744144

 yes she will do for him very well 	10.815147209304623

 she will make him a very proper wife 	14.790982687768752

 <title> collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies 	5.004615924632816

 and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way 	3.6534924611327986

 the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house 	6.519950079355531

 <title> collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day 	3.495622085466081

 chapter vi 	44.72575127815273

 <title> collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 	5.8066863800323425

 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for 	4.228230463773166

 and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 	4.714561350163536

 i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings 	4.787281961940957

 i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen 	8.347918071985237

 but who could have foreseen such an attention as this 	5.6225631097663324

 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 	3.2054516334096665

 scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings 	7.570849423485384

 <title> collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them 	4.246298404937653

 lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter 	2.6457712677668406

 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more 	4.747094893026919

 she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved 	6.579509873221855

 such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st 	4.4756599930170315

 every park has its beauty and its prospects 	4.588005099923241

 and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as <title> collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh 	4.237541549989758

 when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 	3.768445449416727

 elizabeth s courage did not fail her 	9.733376466781424

 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation 	3.1467369513969667

 from the entrance hall of which <title> collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and <title> jenkinson were sitting 	4.066425390571593

 her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them 	5.379562685739234

 james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word 	4.043892875615155

 and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look 	4.9517054196613

 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 	5.275629106120769

 her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank 	4.702463319638473

 but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought <title> wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind 	3.2060997129879993

 and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 	8.968020431177722

 there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies 	3.5409809585842584

 miss de bourgh was pale and sickly 	6.570715793827123

 her features though not plain were insignificant 	5.868600504343228

 after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view <title> collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 	4.604929892931046

 the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which <title> collins had promised 	6.320268447498283

 and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyship s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater 	4.482758572841125

 he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity 	2.801171703480668

 and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 	3.744529208200488

 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 	2.882541691936381

 the party did not supply much conversation 	8.34607998281154

 elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time 	5.203097021315645

 <title> jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed 	3.434849162312556

 maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 	6.237188119115978

 when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted 	4.525890464904263

 she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all 	3.1843993079884916

 told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 	5.982614938411658

 elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others 	3.2856076548723046

 in the intervals of her discourse with <title> collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to <title> collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl 	4.662570491472714

 she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name 	4.568155257903705

 lady catherine then observed your father s estate is entailed on <title> collins i think 	4.737379830785895

 for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it 	6.711398688905501

 but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line 	4.216079097867091

 it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family 	3.5233674191664

 do you play and sing miss bennet 	5.10727941437895

 a little 	48.83374690128346

 our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day 	4.619710010407287

 do your sisters play and sing 	5.763959860530166

 one of them does 	38.81531000466162

 why did not you all learn 	13.965520547891112

 you ought all to have learned 	18.741569530785796

 the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your <initial> do you draw 	5.114507594317988

 what none of you 	18.49771697534942

 not one 	54.00977944719822

 but i suppose you had no opportunity 	12.943397232240489

 my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london 	8.941510014022745

 has your governess left you 	6.10180841522882

 we never had any governess 	21.911204066310894

 no governess how was that possible 	6.459290217650493

 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education 	6.394211417768921

 elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case 	7.2202110086444105

 then who taught you 	9.03419855736286

 who attended to you 	14.488083761866713

 without a governess you must have been neglected 	12.138923162776962

 compared with some families i believe we were 	8.160444728535914

 but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means 	3.9142750664947976

 we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary 	5.109871419864509

 those who chose to be idle certainly might 	8.504368973419703

 but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one 	4.03054664481436

 i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it 	3.2174903874840455

 four nieces of <title> jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means 	4.173429604259078

 and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her 	5.563349101564388

 <title> collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me 	3.660169503267769

 she finds miss pope a treasure 	4.73009674148102

 lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure 	9.959289890909194

 are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet 	8.77657240632214

 yes ma am all 	11.945248141864779

 all what all five out at once 	3.630343989338202

 very odd and you only the second 	9.316870158038158

 the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young 	4.6454074821549245

 perhaps she is full young to be much in company 	9.684190901674343

 but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early 	4.676809009687928

 and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind 	6.655308374565855

 upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person 	3.604017901209759

 pray what is your age 	15.844668330540006

 with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 	3.4380716418515282

 and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence 	6.051270234150962

 you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age 	5.936285084398075

 i am not one and twenty 	6.420410695467743

 when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed 	4.221353460430772

 lady catherine sir william and <title> and <title> collins sat down to quadrille 	9.059794602830934

 and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting <title> jenkinson to make up her party 	4.343254329186322

 their table was superlatively stupid 	5.905620956355905

 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when <title> jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light 	3.5861732783029545

 a great deal more passed at the other table 	6.866132093201905

 <title> collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many 	3.5869654605753336

 sir william did not say much 	13.494141197822172

 he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names 	3.076571587807054

 when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to <title> collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered 	4.085254092743233

 the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow 	5.8275925601253435

 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on <title> collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed 	4.917470586420062

 as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was 	5.25716500750947

 but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy <title> collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands 	3.8518302315023925

 sir william staid only a week at hunsford 	7.799800236257198

 but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with 	5.686482529169336

 but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road 	4.481024214779138

 the room in which the ladies sat was backwards 	11.651427909996332

 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use 	3.6818463290591428

 it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect 	5.840641062790452

 but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for <title> collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively 	6.133689784796921

 and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement 	9.487076503299804

 from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to <title> collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day 	4.422557155623386

 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 	4.784895406231021

 very few days passed in which <title> collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 	7.539038219735187

 and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 	4.4018794628056686

 now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 	5.222591141982885

 she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently 	4.252313646063095

 found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence 	5.293511819603217

 and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that <title> collins s joints of meat were too large for her family 	3.667849875242748

 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <title> collins 	5.1749325032528075

 and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty 	2.703693104014643

 the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week 	3.497474732785108

 and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 	5.113553958443131

 their other engagements were few 	6.779975544693083

 as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach 	7.2544214715006206

 this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough 	4.910225786139803

 there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 	4.639093390152586

 her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity 	3.3552603077830443

 in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 	5.489058769599039

 easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important 	5.40547631439075

 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that <title> darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine 	4.6135747649802

 who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself 	4.924159883202342

 and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence 	5.326544515144481

 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for <title> darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when <title> collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him 	5.199349759221313

 charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility 	3.8071335265439044

 <title> darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me 	4.309973612956623

 elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 	3.590058406385031

 colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman 	2.548139921860219

 and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure 	6.197550521982489

 elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word 	4.541678232357906

 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly 	3.9773786059619276

 but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to <title> collins sat for some time without speaking to any body 	4.301564569565651

 at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family 	4.674095686778678

 she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months 	5.350535188964511

 have you never happened to see her there 	8.05223132245279

 she was perfectly sensible that he never had 	10.658876394423357

 and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet 	5.372868455695805

 the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 	5.531097413410816

 colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings 	6.5197080520372

 it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary 	4.1021396115852085

 and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 	3.552320130426074

 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 	7.165137365520781

 colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but <title> darcy they had only seen at church 	6.142467250798429

 the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room 	4.260552259124766

 her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else 	4.286025710998128

 and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room 	4.610887949261535

 any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings 	13.591437972201549

 and <title> collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 	2.9381503893378116

 he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before 	2.605229697271617

 and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of <title> darcy 	4.036153569328783

 his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity 	6.468598590563441

 and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam 	4.876166173732484

 what are you telling miss bennet 	6.729564621351284

 let me hear what it is 	5.906497431259678

 we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply 	4.947140725245361

 it is of all subjects my delight 	7.96054669551502

 i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music 	7.778694960132677

 there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste 	3.5101719031393244

 if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient 	8.429810326418458

 and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply 	4.128236878203912

 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 	7.918625188647648

 how does georgiana get on darcy 	5.039949207811624

 <title> darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency 	7.630903632507494

 i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine 	7.5546348312536304

 and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal 	5.218636841922172

 i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice 	7.226916097309584

 she practises very constantly 	12.233832601833733

 so much the better 	10.597269234746989

 it cannot be done too much 	10.979779065936018

 and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account 	6.206146337613038

 i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice 	3.727842164879802

 i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more 	4.504218867722286

 and though <title> collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in <title> jenkinson s room 	4.941646806979901

 she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house 	7.54948852347607

 <title> darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer 	4.89548652928194

 and she sat down directly to the instrument 	11.000792304762326

 he drew a chair near her 	4.379839393617641

 lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew 	5.66054159402182

 till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance 	4.294632412139631

 elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me <title> darcy by coming in all this state to hear me 	4.93629579628079

 but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well 	3.8275387698193266

 there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others 	4.955769014041931

 my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me 	3.721206824246333

 i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you 	5.34446724046108

 and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own 	4.424729801219955

 elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say 	5.1040301254061005

 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit 	4.67092158782861

 indeed <title> darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear 	4.044523751009406

 i am not afraid of you said he smilingly 	6.202885865199285

 pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam 	4.796242863531507

 i should like to know how he behaves among strangers 	6.385981986815874

 you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful 	2.8177296949907107

 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did 	5.527559053934366

 he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was 	4.284249990835253

 he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce 	3.0816490629266453

 and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner 	5.73858626413928

 <title> darcy you cannot deny the fact 	6.678856059427713

 i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party 	7.212892802612798

 and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room 	6.657644292510302

 perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers 	3.9795252928002163

 shall we ask your cousin the reason of this 	3.7123719273390097

 said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam 	7.36276493622322

 shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers 	3.820180397855841

 i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him 	2.969659788058114

 it is because he will not give himself the trouble 	9.620077784461833

 i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before 	3.487637134650667

 i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done 	3.903715487303871

 my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do 	5.536336175022547

 they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression 	6.8839034597605515

 but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising 	6.952826197559247

 it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution 	4.294322290199845

 darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right 	8.929789012774153

 you have employed your time much better 	5.885721611855863

 no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting 	7.007771586182741

 we neither of us perform to strangers 	5.83856800163855

 here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of 	6.446370231044474

 elizabeth immediately began playing again 	6.740082068568008

 lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master 	5.695959785639223

 she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne <initial> anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn 	3.4707197477897163

 elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise 	5.654029264670333

 but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love 	4.220331407234747

 and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation 	5.873395059918571

 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste 	2.983010873983619

 elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility 	8.339969361543602

 and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home 	5.676803799368244

 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while <title> collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor 	4.458617392558804

 as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise <title> darcy and <title> darcy only entered the room 	4.278231889975218

 he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 	5.005854636042979

 they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 	3.201574103841722

 he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london 	8.03636267120958

 perfectly so i thank you 	10.172433482719004

 she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that <title> bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again 	6.083090621352908

 i have never heard him say so 	6.200998853896052

 but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 	7.203275672938646

 he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 	4.479257994925371

 if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there 	4.931080113715353

 but perhaps <title> bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle 	8.418946911887204

 elizabeth made no answer 	5.83937520613514

 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend 	7.4167361890593675

 and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him 	5.085538735420481

 lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when <title> collins first came to hunsford 	6.473468628756409

 i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 	5.644088188935139

 yes indeed 	40.479745573517455

 his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had 	4.506572954733965

 my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying <title> collins as the wisest thing she ever did 	5.63752382736222

 she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her 	5.02054221913985

 it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends 	6.177663972521027

 it is nearly fifty miles 	7.550284380737263

 and what is fifty miles of good road 	6.994062323775498

 little more than half a day s journey 	9.647339889619637

 yes i call it a very easy distance 	7.438306170714625

 i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth 	5.958121412884395

 i should never have said <title> collins was settled near her family 	6.448257567775789

 it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire 	6.426711862226624

 any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far 	6.196267340477619

 as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood 	5.923365493355879

 he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family 	6.144238569863426

 the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances 	5.061935536455983

 but that is not the case here  	12.528006490851906

 <title> and <title> collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance 	4.1849978364741025

 <title> darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment 	5.722699123582026

 elizabeth looked surprised 	18.26073936252177

 he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent 	3.928471657313901

 a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk 	3.5385413192917805

 the tête à tête surprised them 	5.60407201247914

 <title> darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away 	4.720713131083279

 what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone 	7.637011374339339

 but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case 	4.911952623948974

 and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year 	4.731635388871967

 all field sports were over 	6.080326342957533

 within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors 	5.094048288213675

 and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day 	5.248059937206161

 they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt 	3.998266103558064

 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more 	5.163369138257816

 and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham 	6.237140142619164

 and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind 	4.587319158953074

 but why <title> darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand 	8.272703296099397

 it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips 	3.7398557330861175

 and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself 	3.416443502263009

 he seldom appeared really animated 	6.3857441629808305

 <title> collins knew not what to make of him 	7.525366280533567

 colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her 	5.651861671853761

 and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out 	4.231209673738351

 she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford 	5.011313096580763

 but without much success 	19.756153221670587

 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable 	5.546154853699786

 it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 	3.6309632251138924

 and <title> collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment 	4.184339341329764

 for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power 	6.613609332847266

 in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam 	4.452619673668016

 he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible 	6.487161620691076

 but to counterbalance these advantages <title> darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all 	4.840393418181416

 chapter <initial> more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet <title> darcy 	4.200493296658772

 she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought 	3.552001645322644

 and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers 	4.357576089914757

 how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third 	5.166500259857189

 it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her 	3.404047189655037

 he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much 	4.030589746179994

 but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of <title> and <title> collins s happiness 	4.005526740407231

 and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too 	4.702839892918383

 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts 	9.6499636301699

 she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter 	5.702550357248113

 it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage 	6.288679561052529

 she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by <title> darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her 	3.3744231156353166

 putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way 	5.002839588601446

 i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage 	4.176069948352141

 are you going much farther 	6.772839498897829

 no i should have turned in a moment 	8.05285942142911

 do you certainly leave kent on saturday 	4.880148696857291

 yes if darcy does not put it off again 	6.414942138028377

 but i am at his disposal 	11.029811549168384

 he arranges the business just as he pleases 	8.185407592944893

 and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 	7.247292190017268

 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than <title> darcy 	3.6879634032878044

 but so we all do 	10.301702245663979

 it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor 	4.644286085466667

 i speak feelingly 	27.90742251749094

 a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence 	4.150381236945536

 now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence 	3.505605271243718

 when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for 	3.9055998475780282

 these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature 	4.6011656565992025

 but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money 	3.655991770165752

 younger sons cannot marry where they like 	4.8577967165740406

 unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do 	5.230449270504339

 is this thought elizabeth meant for me 	5.041471723294507

 and she coloured at the idea 	12.588966368898179

 but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son 	4.0198340623523485

 unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds 	4.484184483210012

 he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped 	13.964949818414652

 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 	2.9517316746662154

 i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind 	3.9771066958512367

 but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her 	5.145884285434445

 i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy 	7.097910023764509

 are you indeed 	24.244764680082397

 and pray what sort of guardians do you make 	6.566562803949551

 young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way 	5.058471065410413

 as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth 	3.684860685258146

 she directly replied you need not be frightened 	6.2377506940131076

 i never heard any harm of her 	3.986614718320079

 and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world 	5.117418949033268

 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance <title> hurst and miss bingley 	4.635810389142063

 i think i have heard you say that you know them 	9.142491992127999

 i know them a little 	12.167726038207764

 their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy <initial> oh yes said elizabeth drily <title> darcy is uncommonly kind to <title> bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him 	4.179621598274044

 from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him 	6.212962660309515

 but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant 	6.233777160998187

 it was all conjecture 	12.33649135634865

 it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing 	5.406700833140812

 and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley 	7.975798519856706

 what he told me was merely this 	9.93355658415118

 did <title> darcy give you his reasons for this interference 	9.417037341464606

 i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady 	4.835434771203471

 and what arts did he use to separate them 	4.804301713722546

 he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling 	7.109138428338065

 he only told me what i have now told you 	6.481098512741345

 elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation 	4.5144284210962775

 after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful 	7.037868032433774

 your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings 	6.843679069892723

 why was he to be the judge 	10.939725560484263

 i do not see what right <title> darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy 	4.249429629644341

 but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him 	6.289775153769397

 it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case 	6.8332268617101075

 that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly 	4.606914543308078

 this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of <title> darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer 	6.395268595564341

 and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage 	2.759484559337829

 there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard 	5.2142004378771345

 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected 	6.011698100909929

 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate <title> bingley and jane she had never doubted 	7.006407660421997

 but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them 	4.905180488688809

 and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 	4.9418062459579515

 there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london 	2.998535783033337

 neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which <title> darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach 	3.7166190532929995

 when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with <title> darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense 	4.170519425541163

 and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining <title> bingley for his sister 	4.457603177308065

 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache 	5.108338369390855

 and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see <title> darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea 	4.855024665050942

 <title> collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but <title> collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home 	5.38658727061818

 chapter xi 	44.72575127815273

 when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against <title> darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent 	4.745508662559626

 but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded 	4.308416053262999

 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal 	5.549691304637779

 <title> darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings 	4.843162035490037

 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do 	4.605120543868434

 she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him 	6.548147969428802

 but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him 	6.083795667226867

 while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her 	4.697191810414863

 but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw <title> darcy walk into the room 	4.173861563530514

 in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 	4.874687895931237

 he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room 	5.189605372183172

 elizabeth was surprised but said not a word 	4.299261707436606

 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled 	4.365542111799882

 it will not do 	15.963162566350405

 my feelings will not be repressed 	12.253854022868124

 you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you 	4.018346809456429

 elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression 	6.3882936834390875

 she stared coloured doubted and was silent 	7.177536829228072

 in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive 	5.907160535065806

 till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger 	2.6696525149271104

 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer 	5.143017190472405

 and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 	6.36000412505652

 as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 	10.965088735786086

 such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned 	4.013453281329844

 but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 	4.978129425430453

 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 	5.402140975411706

 the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation 	3.3349655797459827

 <title> darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise 	3.9797331979490496

 his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature 	5.144362269628899

 he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it 	4.458963388844196

 the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful 	12.27040617168632

 at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected 	4.390812377090977

 but it is of small importance 	7.290482236389538

 i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character 	3.20370797077478

 but i have other provocations 	12.335272861385855

 had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister 	3.543189242006268

 but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 	3.3837573161921974

 i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 	6.050145149491895

 you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind 	4.088969369387259

 she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 	3.3203508666288695

 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity 	4.691530534955745

 can you deny that you have done it 	9.056446500044137

 she repeated 	105.83031029524602

 with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success 	5.698213026082391

 towards him i have been kinder than towards myself 	7.543427982399184

 elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her 	2.903741028451504

 but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded 	3.798440660454073

 long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided 	8.69085554020519

 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from <title> wickham 	6.50567491640278

 on this subject what can you have to say 	7.759375241156739

 or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others 	3.583506037321018

 you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour 	4.624766727165608

 who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him 	4.235355044345666

 yes his misfortunes have been great indeed 	7.879335197628259

 and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy 	10.768728985707046

 you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty 	7.0082463918372415

 you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him 	5.439882103379583

 you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert 	5.790620211408384

 you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule 	4.584363517959671

 and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully 	4.262671488206806

 my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 	3.0347712678301373

 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination 	2.593553494708149

 by reason by reflection by every thing 	4.258575918069587

 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 	6.513783478138352

 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related 	12.503968475548767

 they were natural and just 	8.991297393951408

 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections 	9.92415283452896

 to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own 	3.7542414699736364

 elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment 	3.7876949571101566

 she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it 	5.080403090225118

 again his astonishment was obvious 	9.09275760655048

 and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 	4.553197445108867

 from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike 	3.523052435030487

 and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry 	5.814151176939106

 you have said quite enough madam 	8.15260768019643

 i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been 	8.037799367839732

 forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness 	4.741307833716341

 and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house 	3.942903554584028

 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 	8.733296928585823

 she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour 	3.1320346642509604

 her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it 	3.3821812469282118

 that she should receive an offer of marriage from <title> darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection 	4.464929449126479

 but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned <title> wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited 	3.81604384443302

 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room 	4.090055192001917

 chapter xii 	44.72575127815273

 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened 	7.793860179190744

 it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 	2.893092250608866

 she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of <title> darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road 	4.051423621670531

 the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 	5.436289046421003

 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees 	5.992882878085751

 she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park 	3.8863227323473835

 he was moving that way 	7.598183872532691

 and fearful of its being <title> darcy she was directly retreating 	9.45413758342686

 but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name 	4.2169637063352665

 she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be <title> darcy she moved again towards the gate 	4.747866821523041

 he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 	4.076309109846152

 will you do me the honour of reading that letter 	8.453796818686824

 and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight 	5.798371737670242

 with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand 	3.2563471661953867

 the envelope itself was likewise full 	4.4479549039574655

 pursuing her way along the lane she then began it 	4.825224173259519

 it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you 	3.071788132545162

 i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten 	3.124361395335713

 and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read 	4.396749323409339

 you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention 	4.1794981206978346

 your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice 	6.225182829432982

 the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached <title> bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of <title> wickham 	3.6421720366473362

 wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison 	3.5601191332713

 but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read 	4.241399026008076

 if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry 	5.800124856784488

 the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd 	7.180147342889877

 but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment 	8.522053334248922

 i had often seen him in love before 	11.824038471049986

 at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage 	4.4659860149373225

 he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided 	8.954355862708097

 from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively 	8.03029251214532

 and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him 	5.629413210738665

 your sister i also watched 	13.02874996640996

 her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment 	3.452517298319977

 if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error 	9.425233602920256

 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable 	10.82078181278449

 but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched 	4.203369305272595

 that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 	3.9872727613465107

 i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it 	6.4191692238541

 my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case 	4.910396435890364

 the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 	7.421891043732823

 but there were other causes of repugnance 	5.4926657467690925

 these causes must be stated though briefly 	7.101450956169602

 the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father 	3.1058376309286952

 pardon me 	54.013382882143176

 it pains me to offend you 	10.365630059703888

 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both 	3.919660619080127

 he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning 	6.694288343098041

 the part which i acted is now to be explained 	11.783168283973172

 his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own 	4.8863621419109595

 our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered 	6.882331082723435

 and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 	3.548444966582105

 but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference 	3.9231007586042326

 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard 	5.256158144378787

 but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 	3.666046210091058

 to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point 	4.63692882321118

 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment 	4.332597600069854

 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction 	6.16425204860497

 it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town 	4.534910679891499

 i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it 	5.940228357268337

 that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable 	5.19360815872719

 but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger 	5.525919283305573

 perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me 	3.3771184891505346

 it is done however and it was done for the best 	10.153902506104243

 on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer 	6.491740532488334

 if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done 	8.159363651748729

 and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them 	3.0635359407258917

 with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured <title> wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family 	3.5892328020289974

 of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant 	10.434379544327273

 <title> wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates 	5.905354310707503

 and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 	5.269149346870635

 my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge 	4.301309865795492

 most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education 	5.823970314246251

 he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it 	5.532197378590795

 as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner 	7.5599788034413855

 here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell 	4.788435405122207

 it adds even another motive 	6.688331309076953

 my excellent father died about five years ago 	4.105654963825848

 and his attachment to <title> wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant 	4.855966755596554

 there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds 	3.911296840593425

 his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events <title> wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited 	3.815038284377342

 he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein 	5.237928800725454

 but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal 	5.774012333344121

 i knew that <title> wickham ought not to be a clergyman 	8.189994344224077

 the business was therefore soon settled 	8.23582897299551

 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds 	4.955521269827157

 all connection between us seemed now dissolved 	4.425438892462415

 i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town 	4.429810002923094

 in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 	3.651848261484053

 for about three years i heard little of him 	5.089996935849934

 but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 	6.6867178922040855

 his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad 	4.865849687435598

 he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions 	4.790598155654744

 you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it 	2.9550106048174007

 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself 	5.480313647251933

 after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt 	4.338845221415549

 how he lived i know not 	8.51899056847937

 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 	5.433298391309202

 i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being 	4.426095933871805

 having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy 	5.588808014514206

 my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself 	4.902545752638203

 about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london 	6.398255569055973

 and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate 	6.2462094830603245

 and thither also went <title> wickham undoubtedly by design 	4.723328838146109

 for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and <title> younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived 	4.0782245958384316

 and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement 	4.514551459527186

 and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 	5.09914639052242

 i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me 	3.1201888045926935

 you may imagine what i felt and how i acted 	7.139768309831621

 regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to <title> wickham who left the place immediately and <title> younge was of course removed from her charge 	5.055105187117055

 <title> wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds 	3.4353743136519843

 but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement 	5.028990771370983

 his revenge would have been complete indeed 	8.0365801037396

 this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together 	6.874882748497187

 and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards <title> wickham 	4.032695129477486

 i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you 	3.9188399085662216

 but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at 	8.846479324506538

 ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination 	5.239973689233003

 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 	4.880671083920899

 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed 	6.206518996568485

 for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions 	3.734287790256437

 if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin 	4.097003708283056

 and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 	5.836062331192261

 i will only add god bless you 	4.91597315059471

 fitzwilliam darcy 	124.74212174894105

 if elizabeth when <title> darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 	7.419867947787762

 but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited 	4.48753021394076

 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 	7.019014771076544

 and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal 	5.488406342751505

 she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 	4.212877203788

 his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice 	6.417362069704558

 his style was not penitent but haughty 	7.387410984346056

 it was all pride and insolence 	8.831735433976512

 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of <title> wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition 	2.8358640027828654

 astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her 	5.8462035236207015

 she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again 	4.217223236570337

 in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on 	3.4405827885279154

 but it would not do 	17.098764058979956

 in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence 	4.2621542921846185

 the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself 	7.823380836733006

 and the kindness of the late <title> darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words 	6.3244409703944005

 so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great 	5.2603100119250525

 what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other 	4.634647786697397

 and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err 	5.743318288968467

 but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate 	3.314647599656391

 she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success 	4.71514279895041

 again she read on 	23.205956544554926

 but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render <title> darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole 	3.707750191235429

 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to <title> wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her 	3.8645390814981053

 the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice 	7.122880478942841

 she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance 	4.616660922276296

 of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself 	8.70199264813827

 as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring 	5.714403311998561

 his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue 	5.115575462709662

 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of <title> darcy 	2.4038998595609558

 or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what <title> darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance 	3.606252677298514

 but no such recollection befriended her 	6.084590666790999

 but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess 	5.1994751503236545

 after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read 	4.024042487423751

 but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before 	3.8233379219208343

 and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question 	5.331183665645842

 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that <title> darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration 	5.567656966169023

 she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at <title> philips <initial> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory 	5.413942067421332

 she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before 	5.2935976506239

 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct 	5.381065058193232

 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing <title> darcy that <title> darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground 	6.015335501756749

 yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week 	5.649759632947827

 she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself 	3.9395670950434596

 that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking <title> darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son 	4.160753212146412

 and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing 	4.443334167188767

 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive 	6.691902367701726

 he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn 	3.895784252823071

 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter 	3.398140892808978

 and in farther justification of <title> darcy she could not but allow that <title> bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair 	4.4766110310289

 that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits 	3.762029722796646

 that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world 	3.6920196924901427

 of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd 	3.757140028358496

 how despicably have i acted she cried 	5.034222695239502

 i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust 	2.919964485252376

 how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind 	3.6793832362074497

 but vanity not love has been my folly 	5.2667958467367075

 pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned 	4.703068857949174

 till this moment i never knew myself 	9.197390574143471

 from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that <title> darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient 	4.530982502974209

 and she read it again 	14.112682019251643

 how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other 	6.354057172183169

 he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment 	6.9403935762351745

 and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been 	3.5408787304943194

 neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane 	6.173907616467897

 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe 	4.477339218226996

 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers 	4.640700847921284

 the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt 	14.601227937551686

 after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought 	3.987625409555808

 re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home 	3.9882288376591553

 and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation 	4.122906435674907

 she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence 	3.7868252634476223

 <title> darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found 	5.530610839937135

 elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him 	4.25273493246206

 she really rejoiced at it 	6.8326367793394445

 colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object 	7.537173246740052

 she could think only of her letter 	16.215910596779832

 chapter xiv 	44.72575127815273

 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning 	3.643637622834141

 and <title> collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings 	3.1239558371472143

 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter 	5.217055861448927

 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece 	5.269067741990588

 nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been 	4.358407250781772

 what would she have said 	11.85164672928336

 how would she have behaved 	8.000504811870226

 were questions with which she amused herself 	9.68204208305529

 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party 	8.358305690779797

 i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine 	4.29674065299722

 i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 	4.349998237537102

 but i am particularly attached to these young men 	5.461767999932527

 and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are 	7.683985223615605

 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last 	2.560205047478839

 but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year 	4.771314006517223

 his attachment to rosings certainly increases 	7.2334379660064005

 <title> collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 	4.030035318914276

 lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 	5.106715377340624

 <title> collins will be very glad of your company i am sure 	7.065421570449513

 i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it 	5.403565322226719

 i must be in town next saturday 	13.76799285279742

 why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks 	6.582159531506093

 i expected you to stay two months 	8.362763802916273

 i told <title> collins so before you came 	8.749621037437434

 there can be no occasion for your going so soon 	4.583087889345451

 but my father cannot 	18.568219651919875

 daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 	8.570438338369128

 and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week 	4.369981610370468

 you are all kindness madam 	11.578406126596231

 but i believe we must abide by our original plan 	4.590415086462639

 lady catherine seemed resigned 	12.049041686801726

 <title> collins you must send a servant with them 	5.8116695417391

 you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves 	4.692113670819075

 it is highly improper 	12.515670962269175

 you must contrive to send somebody 	9.703662992380588

 i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 	7.014214904964768

 young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life 	3.612715313815682

 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her 	3.4111059246794992

 miss darcy the daughter of <title> darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 	4.864918225392602

 i am excessively attentive to all those things 	6.810531925085354

 you must send john with the young ladies <title> collins 	5.762647185021129

 i am glad it occurred to me to mention it 	5.641489255946301

 for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone 	7.379313608341896

 my uncle is to send a servant for us 	8.654372366310923

 i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things 	4.482286838307221

 where shall you change horses 	7.601211530456867

 oh bromley of course 	9.789578382213794

 if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to 	6.246915150240908

 lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her 	3.6887914635624335

 or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was 	5.089839188624708

 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours 	7.656517413215098

 whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief 	12.236549672140644

 and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections 	4.576446319641882

 <title> darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart 	5.722155832508432

 she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different 	4.52774987608498

 when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation 	6.799521512527751

 but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself 	2.9611779130131515

 and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion 	4.112591256407141

 his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect 	4.030388085821241

 but she could not approve him 	8.74632147920639

 nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again 	3.0182573549662384

 they were hopeless of remedy 	8.991297393951408

 and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil 	5.096655156319337

 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia 	3.9560889816225475

 but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement 	4.0392628188675745

 catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice 	3.4235087257801458

 and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing 	3.4694707119779062

 while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him 	6.164793216335473

 and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever 	4.424983067765583

 anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and <title> darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost 	4.442733453765038

 his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend 	4.466682128928196

 how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful 	3.149363376961867

 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first 	4.633432178067018

 the very last evening was spent there 	6.2502013355626636

 and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh 	4.332607922514004

 when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year 	4.0091610796058355

 and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 	3.9791358051183283

 on saturday morning elizabeth and <title> collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared 	5.517355248809579

 and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 	4.037928857790667

 the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you 	5.263358839345902

 our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself 	3.285420553297576

 but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly 	4.759027594412302

 elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 	5.576868879038272

 she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment 	5.789359293232524

 and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged 	6.281307735785

 and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably 	4.191103717176381

 we have certainly done our best 	6.521612748733376

 and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome 	3.1379166386951796

 our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast 	2.632632829720063

 you see on what a footing we are 	6.94009106718313

 you see how continually we are engaged there 	7.423995064298738

 in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings 	4.259307026108159

 words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings 	10.647537613652746

 and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 	4.6378948750593

 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so 	8.485600573416582

 lady catherine s great attentions to <title> collins you have been a daily witness of 	5.600264581367025

 and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent 	4.241024854706011

 only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage 	5.476243836697278

 my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 	6.010027335115009

 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us 	5.875897369438397

 we seem to have been designed for each other 	6.39648297064387

 elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts 	4.929694449557428

 she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung 	5.648338942622183

 poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open 	7.312379992684801

 and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion 	5.019377733101508

 her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their char <title> at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready 	3.5053912008981767

 after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by <title> collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to <title> and <title> gardiner though unknown 	5.945970745935509

 he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings 	4.467027644383758

 but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here 	6.336362190706396

 elizabeth made no objection 	14.095172342526313

 the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off 	7.985505454399517

 good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh 	3.574554353232167

 we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal 	3.024075882363392

 their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm 	5.678330260694471

 and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached <title> gardiner s house where they were to remain a few days 	4.391489562280886

 but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 	8.945460514492517

 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of <title> darcy s proposals 	4.8036510614470425

 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate 	4.597808760764634

 chapter xvi 	44.72575127815273

 it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire 	4.2968836894914

 and as they drew near the appointed inn where <title> bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs 	3.6252560097129125

 these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber 	3.0539155956118855

 after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice 	2.534038963421083

 is not this an agreeable surprise 	7.730433022580787

 and we mean to treat you all added lydia 	5.936087726415692

 but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there 	4.147467871326194

 then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet 	3.962521755252939

 i do not think it is very pretty 	7.39994147612108

 but i thought i might as well buy it as not 	7.07148498321566

 i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better 	4.88959517471944

 and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop 	4.176751723120223

 and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable 	3.6791085270465143

 are they indeed 	33.28697391782658

 cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction 	13.490150769474576

 they are going to be encamped near brighton 	10.03153661028951

 mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once 	3.554704095164131

 good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton 	2.723222421363907

 now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table 	6.549901357936041

 what do you think 	7.7505370262864615

 it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like 	3.7032888731437454

 lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion 	5.230191398958354

 you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say 	3.994752668748664

 but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone 	7.028225909246

 i never saw such a long chin in my life 	5.281349441795284

 well but now for my news it is about dear wickham 	6.811343485078973

 too good for the waiter is not it 	10.472035356559969

 there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king 	5.686291449256786

 there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool 	8.918611382845585

 gone to stay 	65.8276182388783

 wickham is safe 	30.8400094016236

 and mary king is safe added elizabeth 	4.576647502194597

 safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune 	9.941731063903498

 she is a great fool for going away if she liked him 	4.638108282165487

 but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane 	3.3836159194898108

 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her 	4.2730153272351

 who could about such a nasty little freckled thing 	5.79783384395976

 and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it 	3.327227380543732

 how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia 	4.830123078909377

 i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home 	2.784570304042147

 and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away 	4.542747689006961

 have you seen any pleasant men 	6.423203517863304

 have you had any flirting 	23.384956446850925

 i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 	5.601633704990796

 jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare 	4.418343184976717

 she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can not think 	3.132872738935187

 lord how i should like to be married before any of you 	10.172588784102647

 and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls 	5.784488007710288

 dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster <initial> kitty and me were to spend the day there and <title> forster promised to have a little dance in the evening 	5.020848203996407

 by the bye <title> forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself 	3.669773907072862

 and then what do you think we did 	6.989449832096199

 we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col 	3.2478730083581704

 and <title> forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns 	5.822651844578961

 and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least 	4.437312063466061

 lord how i laughed and so did <title> forster 	6.311304071055796

 i thought i should have died 	9.31549933031412

 and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter 	4.8938361725231445

 with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn 	3.1821222832246754

 their reception at home was most kind 	8.685018345140074

 <title> bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty 	6.413483670457922

 and more than once during dinner did <title> bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy 	6.008877281730541

 lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter 	3.924404343934807

 <title> bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases 	4.35550542158571

 and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her 	3.735910216112854

 oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach 	3.906236070258604

 and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick 	4.826486570604674

 and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach 	5.357022020500885

 i was ready to die of laughter 	6.991066250020616

 and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures 	2.8332498478420565

 they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds 	5.0137344527377685

 but i confess they would have no charms for me  	7.518318796230223

 i should infinitely prefer a book 	6.64671467897928

 but of this answer lydia heard not a word 	5.189818780756482

 she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all 	4.016440836990701

 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on 	5.712916255485492

 but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme 	4.278920290609777

 it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers 	8.84981283113863

 there was another reason too for her opposition 	9.214272325827322

 she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 	6.548387977440375

 the comfort to her of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression 	7.166636915010438

 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding 	7.621289403178073

 elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome 	3.146748544986141

 and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between <title> darcy and herself 	5.049094964366343

 and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings 	5.703102142347407

 she was sorry that <title> darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them 	4.71933194681003

 but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him 	5.816813128992174

 his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she 	4.164667749104428

 and certainly ought not to have appeared 	11.193924074334953

 but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 	6.521080281116762

 indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him 	10.978062753782533

 but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 	3.612279386701133

 you do not blame me however for refusing him 	6.0478820780797395

 blame you oh no 	11.168801267322337

 but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham 	3.6121816963587867

 no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did 	5.466082825034187

 but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day 	6.515714564260155

 she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham 	5.289285705065934

 nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery 	5.251833452638338

 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other 	2.1382264433262614

 you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing 	6.482508928355321

 take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one 	6.3678757276227635

 there is but such a quantity of merit between them 	4.967029003876315

 just enough to make one good sort of man 	10.194842869357663

 and of late it has been shifting about pretty much 	4.590777187246927

 for my part i am inclined to believe it all <title> darcy s but you shall do as you chuse 	6.138809146603021

 it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane 	4.402670516317993

 i do not know when i have been more shocked said she 	4.791352958196018

 wickham so very bad it is almost past belief 	7.8072836374070125

 and poor <title> darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered 	7.321405460982298

 i am sure you must feel it so 	6.141641284108803

 oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both 	3.478946373544876

 i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 	3.6304060292258016

 your profusion makes me saving 	6.8318616077019465

 and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather 	4.011916958381337

 poor wickham 	83.86056691342299

 there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men 	5.289433718907026

 one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it 	7.523738479088792

 and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason 	4.360620705099124

 it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 	5.236422052683955

 one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just 	6.946550405177355

 but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 	5.666034618201399

 lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 	5.11032283092484

 indeed i could not 	12.169400154278645

 i was uncomfortable enough 	12.130247975217424

 i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy 	6.374026070984845

 and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to <title> darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved 	3.7799825962826525

 but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 	6.1863213600990195

 there is one point on which i want your advice 	8.20121663132431

 i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character 	5.843276528263528

 miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 	3.803880821248513

 what is your own opinion 	17.456827033027484

 <title> darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public 	6.3170624610947135

 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself 	4.591318828444029

 and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me 	5.303765120960588

 the general prejudice against <title> darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light 	5.026814377963737

 i am not equal to it 	7.474709132000968

 and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is 	4.417575283117289

 at present i will say nothing about it 	5.749474740394189

 you are quite right 	12.703826143837839

 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever 	4.128342690117661

 he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character 	3.9748022684591002

 we must not make him desperate 	10.972023278624905

 the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation 	4.490168431903263

 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either 	5.392525395740557

 she dared not relate the other half of <title> darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend 	4.697861725728632

 here was knowledge in which no one could partake 	6.961168834701113

 and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery 	2.8800087459302968

 and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 	3.810671246588784

 the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits 	4.198731750345759

 having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast 	2.939247010899208

 and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity 	4.64105352901296

 well lizzy said <title> bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s 	5.7080560236889

 for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody 	6.189556431729678

 i told my sister philips so the other day 	4.774889533590146

 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london 	5.969621808834489

 well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 	7.362614965829788

 there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer 	7.010192776622307

 and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know 	5.730533666322092

 i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more 	5.681996339759711

 oh well it is just as he chooses 	15.749783730997859

 nobody wants him to come 	12.838030440117114

 though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill 	6.366301368536128

 and if i was her i would not have put up with it 	7.4863102401977395

 well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done 	5.13008069756049

 but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer 	4.582649905370822

 well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they 	4.258477442208541

 well well i only hope it will last 	7.782701775129159

 charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say 	5.672138802206704

 if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough 	8.81949715400615

 there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say 	3.8741313367363546

 no nothing at all 	9.761233465229537

 a great deal of good management depend upon it 	3.8548769407699877

 yes yes 	93.48663389063982

 they will take care not to outrun their income 	6.560206165614432

 they will never be distressed for money 	6.505733496621196

 they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens 	4.7730249131026925

 it was a subject which they could not mention before me 	7.201619277495724

 it would have been strange if they had 	6.254910708734798

 but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves 	5.319954532334583

 well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better 	5.883772674586098

 i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me 	5.49497365682355

 chapter xviii 	59.55252275142669

 the second began 	39.58248267259379

 it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace 	6.112522545669226

 the dejection was almost universal 	8.849453953934116

 the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments 	3.3852656115355444

 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family 	2.994738559060009

 good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe 	4.166405919957233

 how can you be smiling so lizzy 	4.1134426384567355

 their affectionate mother shared all their grief 	5.37314575219231

 she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago 	3.470298805724688

 i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away 	2.5560075181271813

 i thought i should have broke my heart 	5.332177576553368

 i am sure i shall break mine said lydia 	3.9935185245402085

 if one could but go to brighton observed <title> bennet 	3.9473189089640637

 oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable 	3.1551554687008045

 a little sea bathing would set me up for ever 	3.5153297552208085

 and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty 	4.429628761020934

 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house 	3.4703903287362805

 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them 	11.303970129883645

 but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame 	6.307918647398191

 she felt anew the justice of <title> darcy s objections 	6.191159503013363

 and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend 	6.821462416520216

 but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away 	3.819548558658376

 for she received an invitation from <title> forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton 	6.584484816683315

 this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married 	6.605922152243897

 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two  	4.529616200548199

 the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of <title> forster the delight of <title> bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described 	5.3924969888173875

 wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever 	3.4976196169050224

 whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish 	3.5356011395338114

 i cannot see why <title> forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend 	4.52247259573259

 i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older 	7.921772327385314

 in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned 	6.138396401751901

 as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter 	6.278549644676069

 and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go 	4.699773423276504

 he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances 	4.351830038645087

 if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner 	4.47283967347945

 already arisen repeated <title> bennet 	6.892951943730859

 what has she frightened away some of your lovers 	10.017534924707467

 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret 	5.970154198148611

 come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly 	5.138997539719376

 indeed you are mistaken 	14.970255571408764

 i have no such injuries to resent 	6.680368361632188

 it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining 	5.436970251064339

 our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character 	4.413396341769166

 excuse me for i must speak plainly 	16.494968817118206

 her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous 	5.48207237617116

 a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation 	5.966312383471262

 without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person 	8.18237058999588

 in this danger kitty is also comprehended 	6.364327282197814

 she will follow wherever lydia leads 	5.418209015881982

 vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace 	4.6769457371306515

 <title> bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject 	9.641479283065786

 and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love 	4.117884525632135

 wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued 	6.823169227859221

 and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters 	3.480544251252188

 colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief 	6.352344828783876

 and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body 	5.108456388076251

 the officers will find women better worth their notice 	3.8224927190585856

 at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life 	3.2591832666523874

 with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content 	13.724233478997666

 it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them 	3.3164908284650623

 she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition 	3.8011417757205543

 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility 	4.511164821095693

 in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 	4.065680938005521

 she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown 	5.645405174597643

 she saw all the glories of the camp 	15.223182649736984

 its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet 	3.394456361599702

 and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once 	2.528282955040848

 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations 	4.383213046347447

 they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same 	7.819531626139066

 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed 	6.570205886730357

 and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home 	4.72114515731933

 having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over 	3.7469220496465354

 she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary 	3.889395491946647

 in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her 	3.6482974089971307

 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry 	4.605403668648736

 and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 	3.382848166701234

 he looked surprised displeased alarmed 	8.659234750529937

 but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often 	5.242764990944485

 her answer was warmly in his favour 	5.905504407996338

 with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings 	4.481259822309216

 yes almost every day 	10.810045917105768

 his manners are very different from his cousin <initial> yes very different 	6.323775324117316

 but i think <title> darcy improves on acquaintance 	10.393964827497639

 indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her 	7.105001951792408

 and pray may i ask 	6.753044940948561

 but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves 	5.637916691497918

 for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials 	5.707071920579054

 oh no said elizabeth 	10.148216489859706

 in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was 	7.909238764549284

 while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning 	3.039825681181343

 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood 	3.5345246921850073

 wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look 	5.069254585045725

 for a few minutes he was silent 	12.293325941744182

 till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards <title> darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right 	4.6575481304983155

 his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by 	5.439844952553261

 i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe 	3.977033026533321

 and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart 	5.840566958957704

 elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head 	5.748368825419995

 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him 	6.178660177526246

 the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth 	5.401210531939173

 and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 	3.0706797664420082

 when the party broke up lydia returned with <title> forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning 	3.9736732927371974

 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic 	6.145106030406948

 kitty was the only one who shed tears 	7.170755396232872

 but she did weep from vexation and envy 	5.899555496158058

 <title> bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible 	4.440458543638258

 advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to 	10.703048958012376

 and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 	3.9092922337232148

 had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort 	4.426983338574356

 her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her 	3.0108459661139295

 respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever 	3.3419756533108282

 and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown 	6.816925569933601

 but <title> bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice 	3.4922667197305883

 he was fond of the country and of books 	13.516534851101204

 to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement 	4.9644114903419565

 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife 	6.167448316790666

 but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given 	2.2901555376514064

 elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband 	7.912805316960613

 she had always seen it with pain 	8.86658248640354

 but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible 	4.132783313212603

 but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents 	2.827501702495487

 talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife 	3.148764674270519

 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment 	5.009387225148752

 and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle 	3.7882667932072542

 and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp 	3.151034436260431

 upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 	4.797791266112068

 it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity 	4.390305668298525

 to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment 	3.7911805407648935

 her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts 	7.0211188549828645

 it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable 	4.977117586597611

 and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect 	8.786064214461746

 but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for 	6.785692652198841

 were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain 	8.265201316788717

 but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized 	4.253134701491602

 a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful 	4.337018282889454

 and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 	4.187979810289174

 but her letters were always long expected and always very short 	4.06628490360949

 those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild 	4.069044283203975

 that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as <title> forster called her and they were going to the camp 	5.28238622619828

 and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public 	5.071466798954162

 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn 	4.303037527646486

 everything wore a happier aspect 	9.095304618330266

 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose 	4.182996072178346

 an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton 	3.6820002378621064

 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching 	6.592019465759095

 and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from <title> gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 	3.538772641571323

 <title> gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month 	2.9529861414959133

 and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour 	4.337416157041622

 and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire 	6.2053475571305725

 in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks 	6.692143241025588

 and to <title> gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction 	12.768968285801904

 the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak 	4.405140722140479

 elizabeth was excessively disappointed 	10.45560531187664

 she had set her heart on seeing the lakes 	5.718350494616689

 and still thought there might have been time enough 	6.839727691009416

 and all was soon right again 	11.84778254120693

 with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected 	6.514134692135691

 it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner 	4.945419033845133

 but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me 	3.0724538096357397

 the period of expectation was now doubled 	8.073803105131375

 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival 	5.735185573057477

 but they did pass away and <title> and <title> gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn 	5.122861940370563

 the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them 	3.236393431291431

 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement 	3.944681287726829

 one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions 	4.70629134534469

 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay 	4.153960115873569

 to the little town of lambton the scene of <title> gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country 	3.386197340365661

 and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated 	4.452019470903988

 it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it 	4.782069979727696

 in talking over their route the evening before <title> gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again 	4.806789960673118

 my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much 	8.323160262214948

 said her aunt 	26.637684685644977

 a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 	6.126055749991505

 wickham passed all his youth there you know 	4.614108819640666

 she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 	4.895642545054442

 she must own that she was tired of great houses 	9.217742571111222

 after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains 	3.2445519526542457

 <title> gardiner abused her stupidity 	7.566398570453179

 if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself 	3.643939268237967

 but the grounds are delightful 	7.314689787609706

 elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce 	10.196392927434363

 the possibility of meeting <title> darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred 	5.458034823375298

 it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea 	9.057155280137694

 and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk 	7.043798830818128

 but against this there were objections 	8.420622183762406

 and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered 	5.443200543615712

 accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer 	4.223432241797308

 a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself 	4.368503108615667

 and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme 	5.064809985583487

 to pemberley therefore they were to go 	7.2229252881951345

 chapter <initial> elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation 	5.068967523885426

 and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter 	4.746803978002483

 the park was very large and contained great variety of ground 	4.927096334615102

 they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent 	3.229393969845551

 elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view 	3.9482684337185963

 they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound 	3.620948080947662

 it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills 	2.061315246996374

 and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance 	2.569223466742314

 elizabeth was delighted 	20.777214458182918

 she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste 	3.5097443775231394

 they were all of them warm in their admiration 	7.426743099275519

 and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned 	3.471990590786106

 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken 	6.842070049191205

 on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall 	9.644371471492674

 the housekeeper came 	20.45896307383493

 they followed her into the dining parlour 	9.464111824280867

 it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up 	3.2365241874910873

 elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect 	4.694127015895023

 the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object 	3.681408313458836

 every disposition of the ground was good 	12.275133911398527

 and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight 	5.156777268643201

 as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions 	2.382767223452174

 the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor 	5.128997275055916

 but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine 	5.64064235587549

 with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings 	3.9939838108223458

 and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt 	4.439940582210443

 but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them 	6.07708298958131

 this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret 	3.920951895034285

 she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it 	3.940514235708122

 at length however the question was asked by her uncle 	5.0125032408735555

 and she turned away with alarm while <title> reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends 	4.320794314255145

 how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture 	4.931577086816479

 she approached and saw the likeness of <title> wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece 	3.5415201431910295

 her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it 	5.985794576489541

 the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence 	4.985216471991682

 he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild 	4.3034238036196815

 <title> gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it 	6.334579243056085

 and that said <title> reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him 	5.830774052306308

 it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago 	6.184018609631263

 it is a handsome face 	8.814826476008772

 but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not 	5.831264586750579

 <title> reynolds s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 	4.568456013263184

 does that young lady know <title> darcy 	6.331084653455726

 elizabeth coloured and said a little 	10.266726393608282

 yes very handsome 	18.71451227156662

 but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this 	5.666453009425146

 this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then 	4.498172183450131

 he was very fond of them 	8.981487320597381

 this accounted to elizabeth for <title> wickham s being among them 	8.49249071913539

 <title> reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old 	4.954165530207445

 and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother 	8.118515663987232

 said <title> gardiner 	51.798799891510825

 oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen 	4.071664704276958

 she comes here to morrow with him 	5.481128682035573

 <title> gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks 	2.9146223440178276

 <title> reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 	3.8809268719943284

 is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year 	7.990704882019406

 not so much as i could wish sir 	11.824093449464666

 and miss darcy is always down for the summer months 	11.400784908630966

 except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate 	6.375421453102134

 if your master would marry you might see more of him 	4.432003099217553

 yes sir 	53.89894860002956

 but i do not know when that will be 	7.0016281259523305

 i do not know who is good enough for him 	4.0226369469804615

 elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so 	6.139733697829382

 i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other 	5.29131324084283

 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far 	9.7806416215557

 and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old 	5.144373294705393

 this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas 	5.2157615009911495

 that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion 	7.250506140343782

 her keenest attention was awakened 	8.322331508068572

 she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said 	5.289060527437028

 you are lucky in having such a master 	7.541766667845075

 yes sir i know i am 	8.856935108810987

 and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world 	3.3905265630305577

 can this be <title> darcy thought she 	9.360256273591073

 his father was an excellent man said <title> gardiner 	7.654612930076822

 yes ma am that he was indeed 	11.94617945023782

 and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor 	7.470777107377886

 <title> reynolds could interest her on no other point 	5.006857704091075

 she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain 	7.532021115333469

 and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase 	3.7168954171246926

 he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived 	7.56518553983582

 not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves 	4.179772662273261

 there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name 	8.012680562820153

 some people call him proud 	7.427823635766627

 but i am sure i never saw any thing of it 	4.58604994759089

 to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 	4.761454255778215

 in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth 	3.938724243469908

 this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 	5.9945252918259655

 perhaps we might be deceived 	17.163420735867227

 that is not very likely 	16.07472714388589

 our authority was too good 	11.094501915478022

 on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below 	2.867647756649647

 he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows 	7.53018859085809

 <title> reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room 	5.520613094546574

 and this is always the way with him she added 	7.892969335783381

 whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment 	4.786207016853559

 there is nothing he would not do for her 	8.674366951195612

 the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn 	6.197066583387866

 in the former were many good paintings 	10.499073595468621

 but elizabeth knew nothing of the art 	10.730618807922886

 and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible 	3.1513778689455463

 in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger 	5.1673793037542115

 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 	6.258573691787783

 at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of <title> darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her 	5.949002163557152

 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 	4.408727162631492

 <title> reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time 	6.3343298846064275

 the commendation bestowed on him by <title> reynolds was of no trifling nature 	6.151664778317061

 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant 	5.797711513661242

 as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before 	4.557282058371316

 she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression 	2.9075905971142313

 when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door 	5.0622580341031425

 as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again 	4.582432836014116

 her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables 	4.666608610939681

 they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight 	3.8561669407804957

 he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise 	3.9195398974660316

 but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility 	4.731667275209347

 she had instinctively turned away 	8.200248688828747

 but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome 	5.827977440797852

 had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw <title> darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it 	3.594438729524407

 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family 	3.419717351228941

 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment 	4.7447666527085595

 and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 	5.740576544042971

 nor did he seem much more at ease 	6.223140744852502

 when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness 	5.881222501515038

 and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts 	4.76243767634382

 at length every idea seemed to fail him 	6.442060801074607

 and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave 	3.3542286347070562

 the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure 	6.885156238548896

 she was overpowered by shame and vexation 	4.950850608143176

 her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come 	4.686156039152596

 or why did he thus come a day before he was expected 	8.455510485494527

 had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage 	4.4824098496473015

 she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting 	7.661201985462464

 and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean 	5.380817940839043

 that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting 	4.469292705535003

 what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to account for it 	2.9314714546539564

 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching 	4.584848256677873

 but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it 	7.636229590195998

 and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene 	3.9117165411573325

 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where <title> darcy then was 	5.025403632833153

 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind 	5.245007988940165

 in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him 	6.155680048663058

 perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease 	5.834764841461061

 yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease 	12.391855312629705

 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure 	7.413153369763836

 at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 	4.4319083588290225

 they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds 	5.483860739003933

 whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream 	3.5892224943161053

 <title> gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk 	4.2088904458984695

 with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round 	6.723460765818503

 it settled the matter 	12.791006549218796

 and they pursued the accustomed circuit 	5.271527233173854

 which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts 	5.264955716059122

 they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene 	6.022413915946694

 it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited 	4.246759310569553

 and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it 	2.517032784171108

 elizabeth longed to explore its windings 	5.614603505568245

 but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house <title> gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible 	3.7668506485079662

 her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction 	6.416389044978483

 but their progress was slow for <title> gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little 	4.512176391452314

 whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of <title> darcy approaching them and at no great distance 	6.143408080818118

 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met 	5.406584042090543

 elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them 	3.814035650633503

 for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path 	5.412209145328052

 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view 	4.933776159461693

 the turning past he was immediately before them 	7.269744105170767

 with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility 	8.724305560489602

 and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place 	5.577610251742966

 but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed 	3.431020928014679

 her colour changed and she said no more 	7.123776644905952

 <title> gardiner was standing a little behind 	7.487145696251884

 and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 	6.853678977051592

 what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion 	4.627527772144234

 the introduction however was immediately made 	7.057390881093041

 and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it 	4.394686031414949

 and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 	5.976141210936401

 that he was surprised by the connexion was evident 	10.330240826407323

 he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with <title> gardiner 	3.9201694723205027

 elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph 	5.744819050294483

 it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 	4.6818198843800625

 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners 	3.9755006865417832

 the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard <title> darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 	3.8188879677719285

 <title> gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder 	4.121188681039365

 elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly 	9.821955830802537

 the compliment must be all for herself 	10.329491653067432

 her astonishment however was extreme 	8.83703980418381

 and continually was she repeating why is he so altered 	3.8322730634102355

 it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened 	5.994669619349048

 after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration 	3.8100399570314454

 it originated in <title> gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband <initial> <title> darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together 	4.689504066220486

 after a short silence the lady first spoke 	4.46148923622627

 she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow 	5.057886827636108

 and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country 	3.568593776807244

 he acknowledged the truth of it all 	9.139016431380785

 and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling 	5.385195358549364

 they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you <title> bingley and his sisters 	2.5950235359653555

 elizabeth answered only by a slight bow 	5.993350622297679

 her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when <title> bingley s name had been last mentioned between them 	5.077133305143169

 and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged 	6.032300226748898

 there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton 	5.035184782328862

 it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it 	4.990588503543761

 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory 	7.036284637371887

 they now walked on in silence 	9.002119608474796

 each of them deep in thought 	8.19438367629864

 elizabeth was not comfortable 	23.069273644944182

 that was impossible 	56.302785447423155

 but she was flattered and pleased 	7.550429564334297

 his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind 	12.808909032415794

 they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage <title> and <title> gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind 	6.469185958401135

 he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn 	6.015552367165781

 at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward 	5.93112921154116

 she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject 	4.610938444901453

 at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance 	4.80314397367001

 yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over 	4.148930211976668

 on <title> and <title> gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment 	4.8631698348622905

 but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness 	4.215941043230176

 <title> darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 	4.397228811765302

 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began 	6.936254865671077

 he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle 	3.1860786663845384

 i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it 	4.294406840782227

 it was more than civil 	16.78433772646647

 it was really attentive 	19.750149907424387

 and there was no necessity for such attention 	9.654883715141999

 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling 	19.344950475817203

 to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham 	7.762569268882365

 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable 	9.71444347658148

 elizabeth excused herself as well as she could 	5.641416739747388

 said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 	6.080844930332915

 your great men often are 	6.8318616077019465

 and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds 	4.19204215406522

 elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing 	5.916572297245302

 from what we have seen of him continued <title> gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham 	5.892776211754598

 he has not an ill natured look 	8.312929676173043

 and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart 	5.387746216857412

 but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes 	4.065478509878367

 but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue 	6.789098448743889

 elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham 	5.893068696343862

 and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction 	4.473514537579077

 and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire 	3.8669737583812642

 in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on 	4.0768125655071135

 <title> gardiner was surprised and concerned 	7.503019953864713

 but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection 	5.269098941521917

 and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else 	4.827060662737487

 fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance 	5.925676341328046

 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends 	4.8492856144023655

 and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of <title> darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 	5.844063065901204

 chapter ii 	44.72575127815273

 elizabeth had settled it that <title> darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley 	5.3214431432349185

 and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 	8.421134695591409

 but her conclusion was false 	6.139749782956032

 for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came 	4.422631030054434

 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected 	4.162518619108451

 her uncle and aunt were all amazement 	7.201365753733685

 and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business 	7.061956786749049

 nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece 	4.554722318834523

 while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing 	2.81811441898792

 but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour 	4.622465329064382

 and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her 	3.544778650757163

 she retreated from the window fearful of being seen 	9.263446745036878

 and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse 	3.4991347184004904

 miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place 	6.898258557436958

 since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud 	7.4627773001030855

 but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy 	6.933320077634939

 miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth 	4.94438361863446

 and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful 	3.9487737243013834

 she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle 	5.546125256215189

 elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever <title> darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings 	4.167529452053812

 they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her 	4.24365043432391

 and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room 	4.100768376939963

 all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away 	7.087088090520904

 but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again 	3.458994564330043

 he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done 	4.742920920226116

 to <title> and <title> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 	6.491510191238053

 they had long wished to see him 	9.483473319584258

 the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention 	3.83190943944887

 the suspicions which had just arisen of <title> darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry 	3.8976499288543898

 and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 	5.2278839018457015

 but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 	5.084973800001187

 elizabeth on her side had much to do 	8.885549666148513

 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all 	6.694060461254468

 and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour 	4.347134254492137

 bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased 	6.385885571151202

 in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister 	5.349240252452483

 and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner 	6.068684705636868

 sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance 	4.81190076312604

 but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane 	5.586122586023766

 no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 	3.321926609077484

 nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister 	6.377955184504745

 on this point she was soon satisfied 	10.998621554022103

 and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared 	3.415883780644893

 and before she could reply he added it is above eight months 	5.6475228506404065

 we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield 	3.305424253818387

 elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact 	4.78699863642316

 and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn 	5.380819206068531

 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on <title> darcy himself 	8.478710643137052

 but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day 	3.8682532279246775

 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace 	3.424595508688548

 when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 	3.2090777924712137

 their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart <title> darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing <title> and <title> gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country 	4.7068603858781675

 miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed 	4.807447679936856

 <title> gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head 	3.463785414957564

 presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on 	4.180171563160725

 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends 	4.939006923611041

 elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased 	5.318205319357395

 and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little 	4.067079853634607

 eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress 	4.2092163347183345

 but she had no reason to fear <title> and <title> gardiner s curiosity 	4.737194713587441

 it was not their wish to force her communication 	5.533462866365099

 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with <title> darcy than they had before any idea of 	8.622801391537461

 they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry 	6.094200698977346

 of <title> darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well 	7.754814457546359

 they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for <title> darcy 	4.45093675120826

 there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper 	5.0494867542192425

 and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected 	4.434214282273146

 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride 	7.108894993343293

 it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor 	5.500413674684677

 with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation 	4.215179985234645

 for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which <title> darcy afterwards discharged 	4.223812984362111

 as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last 	5.121535000182053

 and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion 	5.266284027984929

 and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out 	3.724198300958748

 she certainly did not hate him 	11.04281141800828

 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings 	4.464401949969373

 and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced 	2.973320769091883

 but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked 	4.127793857322576

 it was gratitude 	27.907944360660643

 gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection 	3.5994229110673515

 he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister 	2.6391261537292214

 such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed 	4.699906141383701

 and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined 	5.696085521731766

 she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare 	7.337108591307054

 and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses 	4.895662648500367

 it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side 	5.025990849380826

 and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning 	5.760252506921514

 they were therefore to go 	12.405559709453678

 elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply 	6.731650732322594

 <title> gardiner left them soon after breakfast 	5.949744237508299

 the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon 	4.67269664367709

 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed 	4.486021932729171

 on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer 	3.3135206161014596

 its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 	3.7514627035723493

 in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with <title> hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london 	6.54488510940524

 georgiana s reception of them was very civil 	10.997932939853463

 but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved 	3.2719406267315576

 <title> gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her 	4.2834730144283

 by <title> hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey 	7.379646959051223

 it was first broken by <title> annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others 	3.735677582479752

 and between her and <title> gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on 	4.736041518561419

 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it 	6.549632702021397

 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention 	5.117936055322316

 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance 	5.778084469121253

 but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 	6.78355214572759

 her own thoughts were employing her 	12.764100414311956

 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room 	4.956788580164403

 she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them 	7.189025453016765

 and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine 	6.163237900337377

 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family 	3.5762200301375344

 she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more 	4.5892994001737595

 the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season 	3.0037740753363154

 but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from <title> annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post 	4.620103272543734

 there was now employment for the whole party 	11.827744244504254

 for though they could not all talk they could all eat 	6.412074148044029

 and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came 	5.474314324271118

 he had been some time with <title> gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning 	4.380813690548526

 no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed 	4.638775687802805

 in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects 	4.239139280799755

 miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk 	6.802670235752572

 and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side 	4.1176375590505705

 miss bingley saw all this likewise 	11.104618524375443

 and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton 	3.9741882670213484

 they must be a great loss to your family 	13.471925972375246

 in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name 	6.323679357827144

 but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts 	6.207403897286975

 and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress 	5.8577100142125476

 but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 	2.583297151815445

 while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes 	3.03912975000034

 but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps 	3.9207408604559144

 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement 	5.872989406887806

 and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own 	4.620474934601772

 elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion 	3.188677679091745

 and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more 	3.56468901994445

 her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully 	4.666186042672216

 their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned 	5.1750950644723765

 and while <title> darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress 	3.8175737727031698

 her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable 	4.215237871430995

 when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 	6.375005006454132

 how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning <title> darcy she cried 	5.711326118446933

 i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 	5.816920874002477

 she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 	3.943259901851245

 for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 	4.271425583001532

 her face is too thin 	12.859023984013499

 her complexion has no brilliancy 	10.225313159927095

 and her features are not at all handsome 	10.819257288358338

 her nose wants character 	9.452871691401933

 there is nothing marked in its lines 	5.775558245371282

 her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way 	5.596740261986741

 and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them 	3.7130416806765765

 they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all 	5.70209229851145

 and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable 	4.098415628059347

 persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself 	5.41454004180541

 but angry people are not always wise 	9.168785413937035

 and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected 	5.9110156311138375

 and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty 	4.0583069154897515

 and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit 	4.0629390722835765

 but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time 	4.639524910992878

 yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 	5.774876692911055

 he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 	4.653546896995845

 <title> gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both 	4.512904437018209

 the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention 	4.393998653935049

 they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself 	5.1031498828237805

 yet elizabeth was longing to know what <title> gardiner thought of him and <title> gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject 	5.6677711342147505

 chapter iv 	44.72575127815273

 and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there 	6.194045881633669

 but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere 	5.979347124900847

 elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill 	4.9669683952394355

 and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves 	5.427888303097017

 the one missent must be first attended to 	6.241436005888493

 it had been written five days ago 	5.932565092439478

 but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence 	2.9432010340505284

 it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature 	2.713187200899048

 but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well 	5.93067107361432

 what i have to say relates to poor lydia 	9.764604754409332

 an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers 	4.587103483884368

 to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise 	4.629163553318148

 to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected 	6.397786652812575

 i am very very sorry 	9.008401762142105

 so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood 	5.292421320354207

 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart 	3.3019171104617673

 our poor mother is sadly grieved 	6.312862783107659

 my father bears it better 	7.008990069651969

 how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him 	5.243594079726283

 we must forget it ourselves 	6.728372957405943

 they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 	2.5077157868403677

 the express was sent off directly 	5.493852052700671

 my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us 	4.58315127164945

 colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon 	4.846927799295218

 lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention 	8.32320173739697

 i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother 	7.324128111277078

 i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written 	4.876194257487823

 without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 	3.215565085496333

 by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter 	5.420225880651957

 i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent 	4.187310101313285

 dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed 	7.441722882310741

 imprudent as a marriage between <title> wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland 	5.292979884185405

 colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express 	3.521855280018496

 though lydia s short letter to <title> <initial> gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that <initial> never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel <initial> who instantly taking the alarm set off from <initial> intending to trace their route 	3.0876483589952652

 he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther 	3.914523544678442

 for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom 	2.664969067229757

 all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road 	6.881442257772816

 i know not what to think 	4.179426353159189

 after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel <initial> came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through 	3.087552312412655

 i am sincerely grieved for him and <title> <initial> but no one can throw any blame on them 	4.157153205197482

 my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him 	3.880484800955696

 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan 	4.598580509832934

 and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing 	4.995223615692824

 i grieve to find however that colonel <initial> is not disposed to depend upon their marriage 	5.85475315789454

 he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared <initial> was not a man to be trusted 	5.1918326780680335

 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 	3.222202490646389

 and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected 	8.991174635805718

 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment 	3.321674479235033

 but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder 	5.170540703253627

 i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes 	4.576760154326305

 but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return 	6.054153967724085

 i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible 	4.675949914605934

 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her 	4.87255746478498

 what he means to do i am sure i know not 	10.389105770110811

 but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening 	4.6741608009273445

 in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world 	5.195997173573797

 he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness 	7.31034362208941

 oh where where is my uncle 	7.774934446697144

 cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious 	4.450412047127451

 but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and <title> darcy appeared 	10.573613949008065

 her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you 	2.9852717999512914

 i must find <title> gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed 	4.5615474096084965

 i have not an instant to lose 	5.701435746085693

 good god what is the matter 	9.105971444844892

 cried he with more feeling than politeness 	5.302125681477717

 then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after <title> and <title> gardiner 	3.4134502310682864

 you are not well enough 	10.578732885083186

 you cannot go yourself 	12.305380051880272

 elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them 	4.928657894050141

 calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly 	2.7165956399369895

 is there nothing you could take to give you present relief 	5.009566001871015

 a glass of wine 	9.203322454890992

 shall i get you one 	10.48836745005425

 no i thank you 	8.378973697036262

 she replied endeavouring to recover herself 	8.975192126798316

 there is nothing the matter with me 	5.391960368668526

 i am quite well 	10.763284052910512

 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn 	4.183946379658623

 she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word 	4.953899029908585

 at length she spoke again 	11.885601054016849

 i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news 	6.357148328375109

 my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped 	4.751212266175038

 has thrown herself into the power of of <title> wickham 	6.509021131839138

 you know him too well to doubt the rest 	5.336955794996125

 she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever 	3.997632836170387

 darcy was fixed in astonishment 	13.868000077744203

 had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened 	4.7347152197066045

 grieved shocked 	124.74212174894105

 but is it certain absolutely certain 	8.882110635713383

 oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond 	3.0401603546429032

 they are certainly not gone to scotland 	6.11522640041946

 and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her 	4.958925801311422

 my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour 	3.8438321062440948

 but nothing can be done 	17.22336367158218

 how is such a man to be worked on 	10.661098822834523

 how are they even to be discovered 	12.064393239235985

 i have not the smallest hope 	6.272166133185514

 it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence 	3.0262984193189544

 when my eyes were opened to his real character 	5.8783387647035275

 wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer 	4.0493496970562095

 he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation 	5.658792668306358

 his brow contracted his air gloomy 	4.387072069871636

 elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it 	4.22826769779101

 her power was sinking 	18.38962706274914

 every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace 	4.758188619705682

 she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress 	3.9539550148075397

 it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes 	5.785088389921845

 and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain 	4.837486895052155

 but self though it would intrude could not engross her 	9.82475163595106

 lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care 	3.893514581114788

 and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else 	5.7545674430252856

 and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern 	3.428237420809195

 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress 	3.5608256495518953

 but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks 	3.1168412546235835

 this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day 	3.890058956263032

 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy 	6.762070417732135

 say that urgent business calls us home immediately 	5.14601676288372

 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 	6.645916694214656

 he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away 	4.123437542943862

 as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire 	4.0056189120030945

 and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 	2.930590377316368

 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 	3.3235883242003896

 but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment 	3.413483710626516

 be that as it may she saw him go with regret 	7.4545461527631565

 and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 	3.579803750534611

 never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her 	4.092254427913938

 no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation 	6.9383149211852055

 surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement 	16.61493838603624

 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money 	4.622239112687417

 and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible 	4.166921731389316

 for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms 	9.429830306279467

 and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 	2.862612944306467

 she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body 	4.55154902928828

 her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object 	4.503704479324768

 the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl 	3.2219359226669595

 a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance 	2.9934271230695466

 <title> and <title> gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill 	3.5200162416811147

 but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy 	3.6795835344761993

 though lydia had never been a favourite with them <title> and <title> gardiner could not but be deeply affected 	5.476030726328307

 not lydia only but all were concerned in it 	4.048243070549255

 and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror <title> gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power 	4.490796652604107

 elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude 	4.733639775297492

 and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled 	3.30120569362257

 they were to be off as soon as possible 	7.878003876897959

 but what is to be done about pemberley 	8.114916941628907

 cried <title> gardiner 	21.84530667491262

 john told us <title> darcy was here when you sent for us 	5.814398926861035

 was it so 	22.920961053346787

 that is all settled 	9.658814392190415

 that is all settled 	9.658814392190415

 repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare 	9.19212993100533

 and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain 	4.78905239379137

 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself 	4.535682048282017

 but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure 	4.416571734285298

 an hour however saw the whole completed 	13.66288642430109

 and <title> gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go 	4.378770255210985

 and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn 	6.845027224193217

 chapter <initial> i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town 	6.112806537860239

 and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 	5.520587210542174

 could he expect that her friends would not step forward 	7.693821567957032

 could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster 	5.419353325011976

 his temptation is not adequate to the risk 	10.933912282263623

 do you really think so 	7.138711475087163

 cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment 	6.297067872348823

 upon my word said <title> gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion 	7.496506942231263

 i cannot think so very ill of wickham 	6.101347566480374

 can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it 	4.458720476123899

 but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 	7.803248039502922

 if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it 	7.848866102334534

 why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case 	5.683012194221772

 in the first place replied <title> gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland 	5.107066086380943

 oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road 	4.336061480494246

 well then supposing them to be in london 	6.798093081863737

 they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose 	4.359555318160137

 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side 	4.059779222568948

 and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland 	4.12242528332034

 but why all this secrecy 	11.968448718119621

 why any fear of detection 	8.778901480120771

 why must their marriage be private 	6.486600323217309

 oh no no this is not likely 	6.965735793463064

 his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her 	3.8701781600831273

 wickham will never marry a woman without some money 	7.055713458136379

 he cannot afford it 	10.900458782951207

 and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well 	2.9505707331979463

 as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge 	5.2188011701850145

 for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce 	7.887693253767936

 but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good 	8.811471461144096

 lydia has no brothers to step forward 	4.875021935718109

 and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter 	5.632246615274792

 but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage 	6.418739351072474

 but really i know not what to say 	4.714101812696688

 perhaps i am not doing her justice 	8.067602210206225

 but she is very young 	15.355199503334358

 she has never been taught to think on serious subjects 	5.635803968084147

 and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 	4.843901155056085

 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 	4.528344445487737

 since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head 	4.71479918233169

 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it 	4.506692069784647

 susceptibility to her feelings 	28.264024664212396

 which are naturally lively enough 	7.805069823375728

 but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt 	7.740954771444591

 but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is 	5.781044861700901

 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word 	10.327570355141269

 that he has neither integrity nor honour 	8.585225860398836

 that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating 	8.969159108215516

 and do you really know all this 	5.170861656505519

 cried <title> gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 	7.494843043451301

 i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring 	6.70874582522929

 i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to <title> darcy 	7.025665175554389

 and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 	3.5063189321385493

 and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate 	5.14918208766753

 from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl 	5.451102773740474

 yet he knew to the contrary himself 	16.449229228944958

 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her 	7.1795226854707925

 but does lydia know nothing of this 	5.5276888643070885

 can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand 	7.59655157783864

 oh yes that that is the worst of all 	6.504700584986615

 till i was in kent and saw so much both of <title> darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself 	8.123729968530526

 and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time 	4.617452413914744

 for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown 	5.263719462761948

 that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 	7.5128230123805055

 that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts 	4.079445427682893

 when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other 	4.316493557290112

 and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away 	6.470273927548301

 when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him 	7.192501166379277

 but so we all were 	8.264970379580461

 every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months 	5.3323537210245195

 but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites 	3.147946082416665

 it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey 	3.3871988019529

 from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent 	16.84406799013002

 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness 	4.223443437397703

 they travelled as expeditiously as possible 	4.722403877176279

 and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day 	3.44970129906432

 and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 	2.974729280976521

 elizabeth jumped out 	21.870974289356997

 and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her 	3.3910656506928545

 elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives 	5.081447435826808

 not yet replied jane 	17.211583039089717

 is my father in town 	17.56622770950797

 yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word 	6.638177342727947

 and have you heard from him often 	10.349609574195467

 we have heard only once 	13.869620259211024

 he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do 	4.632109062730119

 he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention 	4.894014836995789

 and my mother how is she 	10.048663126680403

 how are you all 	19.02048769058892

 my mother is tolerably well i trust 	7.253895832539717

 though her spirits are greatly shaken 	7.4942287759932285

 she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all 	6.266956436673145

 she does not yet leave her dressing room 	9.003712657567135

 mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well 	4.9819896151597085

 cried elizabeth 	33.76519598283851

 you look pale 	41.209637015137424

 how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well 	8.153087738706704

 and their conversation which had been passing while <title> and <title> gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party 	4.386688680387344

 jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears 	3.204805059059253

 when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give 	4.765164549248123

 the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her 	5.0903279299398285

 she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage 	3.382420497305281

 <title> bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected 	3.0396007869068895

 with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage 	3.3588509735147105

 if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened 	5.095399225500581

 but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her 	5.666871614335016

 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight 	5.2528089707008405

 i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after 	4.986862994380371

 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her 	5.146877112353418

 but i was over ruled as i always am 	10.160271243122462

 poor dear child and now here s <title> bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all 	4.111816676815703

 the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave 	6.497225129022868

 and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do 	5.6618213461113065

 they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas 	4.884776377913966

 and <title> gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist <title> bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia 	5.267595295611933

 do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain 	6.324797379880935

 it is not quite a week since they left brighton 	6.071245628466405

 in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost 	4.526440535306176

 oh my dear brother replied <title> bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for 	6.793986475131627

 and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be 	3.3101996190713026

 and if they are not married already make them marry 	6.417640463277288

 and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married 	3.76014833206654

 tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits 	9.673292609582777

 and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day 	2.570744044559188

 oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all 	5.051709627191697

 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 	3.7994125529977927

 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before 	4.880125741857388

 the faces of both however were tolerably calm 	4.453987881384701

 and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty 	3.891896742839791

 as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair 	5.024508980955473

 and will probably be much talked of 	6.516045119515952

 but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation 	2.538301600274163

 then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson 	3.47951571047288

 that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex 	4.433857435950068

 elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply 	3.9428630099345385

 mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them 	4.1284664829299205

 in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves 	7.090680137140388

 and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy 	5.318855060008584

 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible 	4.815609406039934

 the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard 	5.875236566724328

 give me farther particulars 	24.813418973410123

 what did colonel forster say 	12.069199227975954

 had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place 	5.547906597726198

 they must have seen them together for ever 	6.772005281237347

 colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm 	4.591286804054657

 i am so grieved for him 	5.422684026665555

 he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey 	3.981440254631597

 and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry 	10.341426619456826

 did he know of their intending to go off 	14.232796765482673

 had colonel forster seen denny himself 	7.913461471271592

 but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it 	4.091880290966563

 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before 	5.799979593458373

 and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married 	4.463366037133164

 kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step 	5.460897436874577

 she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks 	5.953841517758777

 but not before they went to brighton 	12.298538673229258

 no i believe not 	19.879306147672477

 and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself 	8.133448333997372

 does he know his real character 	6.20185020570911

 i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did 	7.560040815030083

 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant 	10.587080191516986

 and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt 	4.6387833763222375

 but i hope this may be false 	8.575506408245445

 oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better 	3.846680595415901

 replied her sister 	36.006632218227566

 but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable 	3.465443735233161

 we acted with the best intentions 	18.488914185976185

 could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife 	5.482095359336178

 he brought it with him for us to see 	8.579795974225073

 jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth 	6.74389098869561

 these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed 	6.144719574314569

 i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel 	4.75079019134313

 i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off 	5.750506445802904

 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham 	4.893829827697279

 what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing 	5.576609527808609

 pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night 	3.1331826893829384

 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn 	6.017286011628285

 but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up 	3.9429861754014537

 your affectionate friend lydia bennet 	6.8318616077019465

 oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it 	4.708081837712717

 what a letter is this to be written at such a moment 	7.897803508321733

 but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey 	9.66202018006303

 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy 	6.527402998103994

 my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw any one so shocked 	6.060948294180337

 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 	4.935665421119833

 i do not know 	4.922678877524087

 i hope there was 	11.70323009830533

 but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult 	8.178799235210423

 my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties 	4.736221285659943

 your attendance upon her has been too much for you 	7.0180923886860365

 oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone 	5.983962750181271

 mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them 	4.707204295461813

 kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on 	4.092320732844539

 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away 	5.452093010293064

 and was so good as to stay till thursday with me 	7.73396010827258

 she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind 	5.086236556046192

 she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us 	5.033806778078756

 she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth 	5.440622860068083

 perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours 	4.677169089382109

 assistance is impossible 	24.965604399904876

 condolence insufferable 	124.74212174894105

 let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied 	4.4899486624348715

 she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter 	5.43050687261912

 he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them 	3.8190455102011187

 it had come with a fare from london 	6.756942162315891

 and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham 	4.1507189275397245

 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this 	5.903341496441426

 chapter vi 	44.72575127815273

 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from <title> bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him 	5.179385141490841

 his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion 	4.523614524062286

 they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain 	6.0865570762614

 <title> gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off 	5.135941183712483

 when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on <title> bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel 	4.941323296590305

 <title> gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces 	5.296453051982199

 she shared in their attendance on <title> bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom 	7.755551072886452

 their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them 	2.7359709295567884

 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light 	2.885505525512922

 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family 	4.325803890358134

 every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world 	7.110093093477286

 and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness 	6.777709852458136

 elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain 	5.02808111248387

 and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them 	3.0793220977984546

 <title> gardiner left longbourn on sunday 	6.800614286431869

 on tuesday his wife received a letter from him 	5.143850501069262

 it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 	5.343170550399991

 that <title> bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information 	4.508846286700764

 and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as <title> bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings 	6.397918890022628

 <title> gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it 	4.641198904660451

 he added that <title> bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon 	5.6591457175425175

 there was also a postscript to this effect 	4.442838407112407

 i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself 	4.510563515075376

 at present we have nothing to guide us 	8.33581838854186

 colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head 	5.506683684719994

 but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person 	2.7723805183328865

 elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded 	5.17864629306716

 but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved 	4.60931082097038

 she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years 	4.62230626680445

 it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information 	7.416153373660935

 and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to 	4.137199086543119

 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety 	11.084378636509998

 but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected 	6.99380407210337

 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience 	6.79415017094655

 through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 	3.842763163221805

 but before they heard again from <title> gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from <title> collins 	4.636949024595658

 which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read 	5.294579197494403

 it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire 	3.7235622750061164

 be assured my dear sir that <title> collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove 	4.443784190695708

 no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune 	3.456587432224277

 or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind 	3.9992555210928353

 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this 	5.169107576875891

 and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and <title> bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age 	4.370164111160249

 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family 	3.5367129824819905

 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 	2.7431387815910604

 let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence 	3.1131864278256116

 i am dear sir & <initial> & <initial> <title> gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster 	4.491548633852925

 and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 	12.389293423313338

 it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living 	4.33793442450769

 his former acquaintance had been numerous 	14.763429722587507

 but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 	5.688481057508833

 there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him 	5.729326652881244

 and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount 	4.848608737056595

 colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton 	4.3845262785415375

 he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable 	6.260363818212398

 <title> gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family 	5.711410113358596

 jane heard them with horror 	12.607810305031549

 a gamester she cried 	9.203322454890992

 this is wholly unexpected 	13.004327080741128

 i had not an idea of it 	13.937630972206112

 <title> gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday 	7.050081471736588

 rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit 	5.346188447791855

 when <title> bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 	6.003826856245529

 what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried 	4.982263907396028

 as <title> gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that <title> bennet came from it 	6.96687315076411

 the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn 	3.582780694663294

 <title> gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world 	5.375065692226602

 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece 	4.726051230555472

 and the kind of half expectation which <title> gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing 	3.8385878908774935

 elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley 	4.1336625925768695

 the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary 	8.149601904240994

 nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better 	4.387792949672597

 it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two 	5.583972912931073

 when <title> bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure 	8.797311337196733

 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying 	8.676688131964072

 made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it 	5.832624686630428

 it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject 	3.988825480869382

 and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that 	4.451330279221113

 who should suffer but myself 	7.824718114943951

 it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it 	8.60654691136653

 you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth 	5.049814768981433

 you may well warn me against such an evil 	5.102883996559918

 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 	6.856446091235589

 it will pass away soon enough 	7.886293714940391

 do you suppose them to be in london 	8.517104463301328

 where else can they be so well concealed 	7.688024998765398

 and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty 	7.498741160902338

 she is happy then said her father drily 	9.505866154514173

 then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind 	2.832953876298492

 they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea 	7.2351083930478595

 it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same 	4.248734887888768

 i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully 	4.060136487493672

 if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia 	6.359338225329429

 no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village 	3.0154461378782953

 balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters 	5.749012919814849

 and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner 	5.309429156159314

 kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry 	5.163637275884151

 two days after <title> bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her 	4.558527522189395

 but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask 	4.058943161130373

 what do you mean hill 	7.834741748100119

 dear madam cried <title> hill in great astonishment do not you know there is an express come for master from <title> gardiner 	4.425854960806557

 they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room 	5.778825762105562

 from thence to the library 	11.65393074158663

 their father was in neither 	26.33069953251178

 and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse 	4.524005719043064

 upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock 	3.133256659126987

 jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news 	3.4360990095278514

 what news 	98.7054478419646

 yes i have had a letter from him by express 	10.057773025595559

 well and what news does it bring 	8.170831417906863

 good or bad 	23.903302783885362

 what is there of good to be expected 	12.171050038425621

 said he taking the letter from his pocket 	9.627575384266937

 but perhaps you would like to read it 	8.656897691612787

 elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 	7.631760163156194

 jane now came up 	9.698932953209175

 read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about 	4.997486443859769

 gracechurch street monday august <number>  	8.16125912184197

 my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction 	5.790535292356529

 soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were 	5.16651560550546

 the particulars i reserve till we meet 	5.913271134763968

 they are married elizabeth read on 	4.638740501578603

 i have seen them both 	9.505525240858287

 they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so 	4.8394270100189525

 but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are 	4.97804307674148

 all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister 	3.9713509743078017

 and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum 	2.4881658554220434

 these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you 	4.63359007280032

 i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer 	3.0086788830987725

 you will easily comprehend from these particulars that <title> wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be 	4.43354431588781

 the world has been deceived in that respect 	12.2209088917871

 and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune 	3.89676720165725

 if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement 	3.398417965681451

 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again 	11.193619103683568

 therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care 	4.979094824780277

 we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve 	6.046676881620714

 she comes to us to day 	11.558219933329395

 is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished 	8.347987169451827

 can it be possible that he will marry her 	7.990523047815038

 said her sister 	46.54120672172426

 my dear father i congratulate you 	6.683023595036212

 said elizabeth 	44.33481539353563

 but it must be done soon 	10.929300564322375

 most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 	5.767493085005537

 oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately 	4.294062300869138

 let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself 	7.441374344738767

 but it must be done 	9.650726167817657

 and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house 	4.0093536917492605

 and may i ask 	15.141884907677767

 complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little 	9.156960847608472

 and they must marry yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry 	5.066397721265292

 there is nothing else to be done 	9.110303898783464

 but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about 	4.918681986989619

 and the other how i am ever to pay him 	9.909889788563396

 money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir 	6.09241950936102

 i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone 	3.93159757702719

 that is very true said elizabeth 	7.207548650119972

 though it had not occurred to me before 	14.217031449588324

 his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself 	3.90191308970046

 a small sum could not do all this 	7.9028868288544825

 no said her father wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds 	5.321873426007142

 ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid 	6.958283298915818

 <title> bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house 	2.438296872633253

 their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room 	5.348412377361249

 and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves 	8.935398824308514

 how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful 	8.4975156209908

 that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her 	3.909450337707907

 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced 	3.9274461224318213

 he has children of his own and may have more 	6.714078947795877

 how could he spare half ten thousand pounds 	4.206136539266486

 if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what <title> gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own 	4.701818035644032

 the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 	6.783979754071678

 their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge 	3.138432529054077

 by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy 	4.185741550161045

 his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking 	6.176184758731019

 their mutual affection will steady them 	4.392596462368638

 their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget 	3.6605787973410617

 it is useless to talk of it 	6.419339434782053

 it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 	6.285094869715044

 they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 	5.498921561145627

 he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please 	4.320277654137906

 may we take my uncle s letter to read to her 	5.3990071505602

 take whatever you like and get away 	4.830181462111572

 elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together 	6.2590176219590585

 mary and kitty were both with <title> bennet one communication would therefore do for all 	4.301590751308969

 after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud 	4.596319942749722

 <title> bennet could hardly contain herself 	7.156381777825904

 as soon as jane had read <title> gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance 	3.734209301388337

 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation 	3.9988120452998595

 to know that her daughter would be married was enough 	12.474131847634073

 she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct 	5.617908656394806

 how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly 	5.0542938450926025

 lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her 	7.642615281403114

 ring the bell kitty for hill 	6.735392629057923

 i will put on my things in a moment 	6.138164665469898

 my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which <title> gardiner s behaviour laid them all under 	3.6392596880474146

 for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness 	6.4859845334105115

 we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist <title> wickham with money 	7.650700551486931

 well cried her mother it is all very right 	9.09491737395823

 if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents 	7.026829759156763

 well i am so happy 	15.563645391339348

 in a short time i shall have a daughter married 	9.551639719758377

 <title> wickham how well it sounds 	8.945176442842612

 and she was only sixteen last june 	5.364861466577784

 so i will dictate and you write for me 	9.702527985333749

 she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted 	3.5748283877416687

 one day s delay she observed would be of small importance 	7.449924981690887

 and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual 	8.761461476091688

 other schemes too came into her head 	6.432170362547168

 i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips 	5.669499066943112

 and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and <title> long 	7.950477470557238

 kitty run down and order the carriage 	4.674283737497892

 an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure 	3.7056477968883077

 oh here comes hill 	9.789578382213794

 my dear hill have you heard the good news 	5.50905303261015

 miss lydia is going to be married 	11.350992600163224

 and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding 	5.329322105342109

 <title> hill began instantly to express her joy 	5.622695964874802

 but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful 	11.93503274789635

 and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister 	2.6206040729092286

 in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained 	5.03178119424609

 he now wished it more than ever 	8.47842732972071

 had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 	3.9033149028941856

 the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place 	3.433546984639981

 he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 	4.504729747706671

 when first <title> bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless 	5.635268200854904

 this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for 	3.5466623081898527

 five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come 	7.264667853142708

 and <title> bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would 	6.369648063075492

 this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving 	6.160125241281457

 <title> bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 	2.88219935596756

 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents 	7.1013932646819935

 this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and <title> bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him 	5.791371094916429

 he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement 	4.755253641023731

 he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them 	5.002486781090444

 for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum 	4.002964996214931

 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise 	4.137974276859555

 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence 	3.4037538379193406

 his letter was soon dispatched 	18.1526762184568

 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother 	8.15255928586069

 but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her 	5.002800510173216

 the good news quickly spread through the house 	6.731787376706792

 and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood 	6.297983911523946

 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy 	7.442592988326524

 to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town 	4.235605714461095

 or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house 	5.035366923234161

 but there was much to be talked of in marrying her 	9.048652046330597

 and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain 	3.701058849219636

 it was a fortnight since <title> bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high 	5.059937374022493

 the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants 	4.04468273434602

 haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger 	3.3532066296156904

 but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me 	4.337033285784785

 and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful 	3.1476772492831637

 but when they had withdrawn he said to her <title> bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding 	4.277042724758516

 a long dispute followed this declaration 	6.8192735325871805

 but <title> bennet was firm it soon led to another 	4.393575933130155

 and <title> bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter 	4.020427300736743

 he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion 	4.326852334066294

 <title> bennet could hardly comprehend it 	7.156381777825904

 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible 	3.860998945285707

 she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place 	3.5121893942227542

 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make <title> darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister 	7.190372572700507

 for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot 	4.049700379298322

 she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means 	5.035701805689054

 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended 	4.52271509531479

 but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much 	5.57106901685144

 not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself 	3.666455598677549

 for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them 	3.4368468911355383

 had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that <title> darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned 	4.004375909041995

 the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this 	4.703657028176143

 she was humbled she was grieved 	11.674554867759028

 she was convinced that she could have been happy with him 	7.189301067664143

 when it was no longer likely they should meet 	9.682130945932915

 what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex 	4.288776725960047

 but while he was mortal there must be a triumph 	7.537174663930497

 she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her 	4.385600412054467

 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both 	8.219753441194934

 by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance 	4.55175278945815

 but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was 	2.3581930681453587

 an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family 	6.562422649371875

 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine 	6.426982013970914

 but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture 	2.864203624421626

 <title> gardiner soon wrote again to his brother 	6.019868547931889

 to <title> bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family 	4.838320202475504

 and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again 	7.651825551396069

 the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that <title> wickham had resolved on quitting the militia 	6.673528232580226

 it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on 	4.534619298244211

 and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece <initial> it is <title> wickham s intention to go into the regulars 	4.102753062117182

 he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north 	4.8041020730519595

 it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom 	10.148260585415333

 i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of <title> wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself 	3.5607979644427963

 and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information 	3.663938000118068

 he has given in all his debts 	8.660487614205937

 i hope at least he has not deceived us 	8.62725921972182

 haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week 	6.16392817345205

 they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn 	3.7199695225197043

 and i understand from <title> gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south 	4.659157429928343

 she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother 	7.729877095050057

 your s & <initial> <initial> gardiner 	6.882014592129211

 <title> bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as <title> gardiner could do 	5.409417661950545

 but <title> bennet was not so well pleased with it 	9.35184185474587

 lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment 	5.412454987653722

 and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites 	7.089729757391515

 she is so fond of <title> forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much 	5.704017826724542

 the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment 	5.870839714664377

 his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative 	4.66755295111457

 but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished 	4.486361851661059

 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north 	6.537118014422113

 when <title> bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come 	4.26278753979347

 and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn 	5.386709108436691

 elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes 	5.0384065387831045

 their sister s wedding day arrived 	7.9050414593650755

 and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself 	10.219173723077661

 the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time 	6.507737659719479

 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets 	6.002678033991563

 and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 	4.406048814441989

 the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them 	8.455035436393867

 smiles decked the face of <title> bennet as the carriage drove up to the door 	6.339006479451769

 her husband looked impenetrably grave 	12.500958962128816

 her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy 	6.971477788875132

 lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule 	11.267443162988426

 the door was thrown open and she ran into the room 	5.196532569170161

 gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness 	3.8724929362929084

 their reception from <title> bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial 	6.2171624966709675

 his countenance rather gained in austerity 	4.385023263023593

 and he scarcely opened his lips 	6.425485368880901

 the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him 	5.593288774378095

 elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked 	6.7029221082097115

 lydia was lydia still 	9.89742226801388

 untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless 	4.996559256118642

 she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there 	3.6061221960134313

 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all 	4.320511098379149

 but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man 	3.9585853951831638

 she blushed and jane blushed 	14.4757672109795

 but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour 	3.3821491534473274

 there was no want of discourse 	9.877142011185285

 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough 	5.471018125918454

 and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies 	4.163283000736565

 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world 	7.699542296212194

 nothing of the past was recollected with pain 	7.050125788335446

 and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 	5.609927028402654

 only think of its being three months she cried since i went away 	4.851336413990972

 it seems but a fortnight i declare 	6.868492068040623

 and yet there have been things enough happened in the time 	7.242696556490319

 good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was 	5.517620098068647

 her father lifted up his eyes 	7.39888804855168

 jane was distressed 	21.746358470658805

 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia 	5.713615548138526

 but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day 	4.0077810251350785

 i was afraid they might not 	9.765884265794583

 and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing 	3.281093343989269

 elizabeth could bear it no longer 	6.782883047562224

 she got up and ran out of the room 	6.266333620216647

 and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour 	5.663137366061462

 it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first 	3.6419937338442807

 her ease and good spirits increased 	8.266178170278323

 she longed to see <title> philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called <title> wickham by each of them 	5.227982149823701

 well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband 	7.281219341452876

 i am sure my sisters must all envy me 	3.7286248399156796

 they must all go to brighton 	6.818626822084519

 that is the place to get husbands 	12.67288900188492

 and if i had my will we should 	4.967522299942595

 but my dear lydia i do not at all like your going such a way off 	6.013002886333004

 must it be so 	21.6042190621133

 oh lord yes 	20.92246818440097

 there is nothing in that 	9.402928307776808

 i shall like it of all things 	11.010786945767666

 we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all 	4.907717621377134

 i should like it beyond any thing said her mother 	5.836137587981633

 and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you 	5.566036374913239

 and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over 	4.490273087698512

 i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth 	8.382192455451051

 but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 	5.83132750917027

 their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them 	5.437592096345291

 <title> wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 	6.147870334681778

 no one but <title> bennet regretted that their stay would be so short 	8.138905093023254

 and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home 	5.371370218852986

 these parties were acceptable to all 	5.496164278001568

 to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not 	3.5708756117551177

 wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it 	5.98683273006247

 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his 	5.240895682510569

 and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 	7.134977154430957

 he was her dear wickham on every occasion 	6.797476393576245

 no one was to be put in competition with him 	6.421938900072988

 he did every thing best in the world 	8.758667749176132

 and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country 	4.24822938714369

 one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe 	4.542254378611273

 you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it 	6.835627976156827

 are not you curious to hear how it was managed 	13.050212402161373

 i think there cannot be too little said on the subject 	5.692021707387305

 la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off 	6.877488566918144

 we were married you know at st 	9.564211923755098

 clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish 	7.895568568530779

 my uncle and aunt and i were to go together 	9.479116538919133

 and the others were to meet us at the church 	11.071394110662808

 well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted 	4.8185010302503555

 however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham 	6.241118753210515

 i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat 	9.279399572892585

 well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual 	4.212253705893511

 i thought it would never be over 	13.019783124714266

 for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them 	5.5945173852832335

 if you will believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight 	4.77573207329457

 not one party or scheme or any thing 	4.397153435925199

 to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open 	4.295913568931848

 well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man <title> stone 	4.455136533785742

 well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away 	9.646019065178512

 and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day 	5.86538634227589

 but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out 	5.174885704962409

 however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for <title> darcy might have done as well 	4.6677333049576

 <title> darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement 	6.088080975477412

 oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know 	7.3048257043039575

 but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it 	4.984062289344292

 i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say 	3.7783395733954928

 it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject 	5.4323587386850996

 you may depend upon my seeking no further 	5.08575825448398

 oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity 	5.489641771172581

 we will ask you no questions 	5.64473443737513

 thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry 	7.680487075495698

 or at least it was impossible not to try for information 	6.895029224714956

 <title> darcy had been at her sister s wedding 	9.003601315917004

 it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go 	3.2581017584044107

 conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain 	5.959739609104469

 but she was satisfied with none 	9.956231992282683

 those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable 	3.302890369452195

 she could not bear such suspense 	7.607284174430868

 and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended 	3.5540462172291916

 you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time 	3.8353878431421946

 and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance 	11.490753724477319

 not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter 	10.42967582088266

 and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out 	4.216414860860957

 jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall 	5.952409495064763

 till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante 	3.4637761159973492

 chapter <initial> elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could 	5.571227665367623

 she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy 	5.683234190717681

 for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial 	9.991345454859685

 gracechurch street sept 	33.08226821492614

 my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you 	4.06249382636932

 i must confess myself surprised by your application 	5.740625938357894

 i did not expect it from you  	7.422889995162614

 do not think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side 	4.67994082253268

 if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence 	4.093151831539446

 your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done 	7.2068414438703305

 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor 	5.744323184231005

 <title> darcy called and was shut up with him several hours 	6.113742934020777

 so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been 	4.497620980668752

 he came to tell <title> gardiner that he had found out where your sister and <title> wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once 	5.991636278190776

 from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them 	4.96843305432679

 the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him 	3.4662984171483697

 his character was to speak for itself 	16.046186443638963

 he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself 	3.0131735080564757

 if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him 	6.676709179205852

 he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them 	7.373862348004084

 and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us 	6.9242076143035876

 there is a lady it seems a <title> younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what 	4.257319731208262

 she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 	3.3436711449203655

 this <title> younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham 	5.590719794152752

 and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town 	8.26181497577413

 but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted 	6.52909673075697

 she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found 	3.9104750330254228

 wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her 	4.845349439665616

 at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction 	2.6825845984601715

 they were in street 	17.284676124726968

 he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia 	6.250411541977636

 his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go 	5.120643222604303

 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 	3.3354730202615417

 she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham 	5.805951901941565

 she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when 	6.757156355386258

 he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing 	4.848651222955328

 and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone 	5.676497782226373

 he meant to resign his commission immediately 	5.645667203684064

 and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it 	5.449055670083926

 <title> darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once 	7.395542098603382

 though <title> bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage 	7.483309699700633

 but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country 	2.919067411317551

 under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief 	5.533182480767363

 they met several times for there was much to be discussed 	9.960603166916831

 wickham of course wanted more than he could get 	8.868000050077015

 but at length was reduced to be reasonable 	11.782414854345866

 every thing being settled between them <title> darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home 	5.541899695474953

 but <title> gardiner could not be seen and <title> darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning 	5.207052036857917

 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former 	5.549050218582751

 on saturday he came again 	12.35894182702462

 your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together 	7.35715313505533

 it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn 	4.275092164031498

 but our visitor was very obstinate 	9.856971951034703

 i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all 	5.580895361422049

 but this is the true one 	12.993918956505098

 nothing was to be done that he did not do himself 	12.347929222514148

 though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole 	4.361406852505646

 they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 	4.599118809822177

 but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain 	4.124120893313823

 and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due 	3.573330099882151

 but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most 	3.449401640084404

 you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people 	6.7453332564900705

 his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased 	4.52734252547159

 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above 	6.8905697654326845

 perhaps there was some truth in this  	10.748639612556543

 though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event 	3.674372845280131

 but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair 	4.274931312332173

 but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish 	4.781597799121346

 i believe i have now told you every thing 	6.705094257740043

 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise 	5.873230239217873

 i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 	6.146487252233288

 lydia came to us 	22.580656349732394

 and wickham had constant admission to the house 	6.805921879834836

 he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire 	8.859942710632312

 but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain 	4.786403271373191

 i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 	7.343576814504184

 if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen 	8.562560188651963

 i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her 	4.1281460680095075

 <title> darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding 	5.080491520055945

 he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday 	5.457054467930231

 will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him 	6.060099784772342

 his understanding and opinions all please me 	4.155236005439341

 he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him 	4.962000966203466

 i thought him very sly 	11.391631719729995

 he hardly ever mentioned your name 	6.6301689269191195

 but slyness seems the fashion 	6.573662693371085

 pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from <initial> i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park 	4.720793134364858

 a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing 	5.964921574622386

 the children have been wanting me this half hour 	5.730946240110512

 your s very sincerely <initial> gardiner 	4.877037625636582

 the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share 	3.8385410480157667

 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what <title> darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research 	3.545382112220316

 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem 	6.09637974805904

 her heart did whisper that he had done it for her 	5.9004132444772

 brother in law of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection 	5.2753944638695405

 he had to be sure done much 	10.068994034564417

 she was ashamed to think how much 	7.4910460745146406

 but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief 	3.6623565631728243

 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong 	8.806713877267503

 he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it 	8.107127326220978

 and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned 	3.946480812221026

 it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return 	5.182416473865742

 they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him 	5.824441761612029

 for herself she was humbled 	19.257014692058302

 but she was proud of him 	8.219878031607497

 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself 	6.042850604853781

 she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again 	6.117304017752211

 she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach 	5.977436305283502

 and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham 	5.036459694401205

 i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister 	3.0111360962852856

 said he as he joined her 	13.523582970305707

 you certainly do she replied with a smile 	5.795894577147211

 but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome 	8.40686322995445

 i should be sorry indeed if it were 	4.511732832260522

 we were always good friends 	9.885526305435373

 and now we are better 	11.872152470860646

 are the others coming out 	17.514398281170127

 i do not know 	4.922678877524087

 <title> bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton 	7.809794983728858

 and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley 	5.48160535470585

 she replied in the affirmative 	27.147981867135464

 and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose 	5.553140319546034

 poor reynolds she was always very fond of me 	7.600711274481745

 but of course she did not mention my name to you 	6.60516622263645

 yes she did 	17.775428185806643

 and what did she say 	13.86083803514444

 that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well 	6.944702538247372

 at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented 	7.407417917780733

 certainly he replied biting his lips 	6.856385127551964

 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him 	13.564722191805904

 but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month 	7.561550355935429

 we passed each other several times 	7.936731252101582

 i wonder what he can be doing there 	9.37879129101861

 perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth 	5.644520966288002

 it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year 	5.10176346387016

 did you see him while you were at lambton 	9.110705455921927

 i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had 	7.925736144609173

 he introduced us to his sister 	9.174364600058807

 and do you like her 	16.523139056662764

 very much 	91.2904831056446

 i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two 	4.165700282478884

 when i last saw her she was not very promising 	8.855878781265021

 i am very glad you liked her 	4.653768206091659

 i hope she will turn out well 	7.726372140428211

 i dare say she will 	7.59651699339225

 she has got over the most trying age 	7.18704407547908

 did you go by the village of kympton 	7.340777202420684

 i do not recollect that we did 	6.527213136894294

 i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had 	7.6635523337136915

 a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect 	3.687255933110915

 how should you have liked making sermons 	8.514410639683833

 exceedingly well 	124.74212174894105

 i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing 	7.814784471906963

 one ought not to repine 	14.356045634573041

 but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be 	4.6993130925829645

 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent 	5.449185138087436

 i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron 	5.424891382304506

 you have 	15.701560311878165

 yes there was something in that  	12.702210925441722

 i told you so from the first you may remember 	9.134007896946825

 i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present 	5.541644020598695

 that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly 	5.360528071936133

 you did and it was not wholly without foundation 	9.915546475120703

 you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it 	3.868801167903174

 they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him 	5.244899109391505

 and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile come <title> wickham we are brother and sister you know 	4.545225559955434

 do not let us quarrel about the past 	8.405826440020753

 in future i hope we shall be always of one mind 	7.415762849745695

 she held out her hand 	6.454223908744144

 he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house 	4.878313751124503

 chapter xi 	44.72575127815273

 <title> wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it 	3.1746751129494655

 and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet 	6.745508975923063

 the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and <title> bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 	4.7799152134598835

 oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again 	4.599878106419745

 oh lord i do not know 	5.854866188028883

 not these two or three years perhaps 	6.739992210716798

 write to me very often my dear 	13.107020227781716

 as often as i can 	20.186999561639293

 they will have nothing else to do 	11.046007724832098

 <title> wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife <initial> he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things 	3.3934305553319013

 he is as fine a fellow said <title> bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw 	4.896789323050368

 he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all 	3.181498242200706

 i am prodigiously proud of him 	6.058177937710698

 i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law 	3.7252217965917866

 the loss of her daughter made <title> bennet very dull for several days 	6.3919016880529576

 i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends 	4.543693358299956

 one seems so forlorn without them 	4.3531972752443275

 this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth 	4.174441930025761

 it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single 	4.863564797242001

 it is no such thing 	16.398761643762874

 lydia does not leave me because she is married 	8.95188498815852

 but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off 	7.237905962762672

 if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon 	8.731181005699963

 but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation 	3.516372786875513

 <title> bennet was quite in the fidgets 	15.573779079446181

 she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns 	4.7237222670698005

 well well and so <title> bingley is coming down sister for <title> philips first brought her the news 	5.459920172337056

 well so much the better 	9.355379248015367

 not that i care about it though 	9.350168232578527

 he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again 	6.68092352104065

 but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it 	7.040142787014378

 and who knows what may happen 	9.905702271766907

 but that is nothing to us 	11.791046307692616

 you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 	3.344811220367103

 and so is it quite certain he is coming 	9.026891771258343

 you may depend on it replied the other for <title> nicholls was in meryton last night 	5.458629814454369

 i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it 	3.442632137133454

 he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday 	4.771585448755167

 she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed 	3.986040185725962

 miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour 	7.971242964330128

 but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report 	5.059639642337002

 and i know i appeared distressed 	9.134948189824943

 but do not imagine it was from any silly cause 	8.408399232598095

 i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at 	8.132322927262027

 i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain 	4.208787753123309

 i am glad of one thing that he comes alone 	7.776364817391345

 elizabeth did not know what to make of it 	8.016936763824571

 had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged 	5.2253359954693215

 but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it 	5.355973754026531

 yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself 	4.230510794311999

 in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 	6.002123619974793

 they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them 	4.97592236497173

 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again 	3.717930030201678

 no no 	54.93386693293281

 you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters 	5.600045614146803

 his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield 	5.540237877206419

 tis an etiquette i despise said he 	3.7456838024883856

 he knows where we live 	9.232062060269692

 i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again 	2.9121538466898382

 well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him 	7.109276134635334

 but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined 	5.381087121684732

 we must have <title> long and the gouldings soon 	11.858249997419586

 that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him 	3.0475538613584665

 consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility 	7.760342762823988

 though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see <title> bingley in consequence of it before they did 	6.3980258029039465

 as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister 	7.979938485962115

 it would be nothing 	20.165939837797797

 i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of 	4.812647942010584

 happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth 	3.6716306191819617

 but it is wholly out of my power 	11.542984035721963

 you must feel it 	10.099273694056262

 <title> bingley arrived 	38.06015761852807

 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent 	3.446474944113241

 hopeless of seeing him before 	13.89377025527278

 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy 	4.736487967756307

 jane resolutely kept her place at the table 	6.770837905689686

 but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw <title> darcy with him and sat down again by her sister 	5.946602767641126

 there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty 	6.764002582240661

 who can it be 	11.341891402635346

 some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose 	8.985708086800745

 i am sure i do not know 	3.9759553578330413

 la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before 	4.387311453435073

 that tall proud man 	10.272972864556186

 good gracious <title> darcy and so it does i vow 	9.637705500934839

 well any friend of <title> bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure 	4.952460202242868

 jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 	8.055216056348236

 she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter 	4.233406494791897

 both sisters were uncomfortable enough 	9.73699175412587

 each felt for the other and of course for themselves 	11.378789136996586

 to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued 	7.876576356647343

 but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley 	4.029179541357191

 her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire 	3.37464320311476

 the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken 	3.875064771416097

 but she would not be secure 	12.179640174614134

 let me first see how he behaves said she 	4.045881987453181

 it will then be early enough for expectation 	5.710991463055671

 she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door 	4.474085119176282

 jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected 	3.541977125912426

 on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased 	5.56729572546829

 yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance 	3.8062779065445924

 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command 	5.024838461734625

 she had ventured only one glance at darcy 	5.482596223942515

 he looked serious as usual 	8.659234750529937

 and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley 	6.613380808231369

 but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 	6.304351258188458

 it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture 	5.314841080404107

 bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed 	4.573350831652178

 he was received by <title> bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend 	4.265833207334234

 elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied 	3.752012287637102

 darcy after enquiring of her how <title> and <title> gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing 	4.5086790411236075

 he was not seated by her 	7.859107256994185

 perhaps that was the reason of his silence 	13.611262476665535

 but it had not been so in derbyshire 	9.769344893712876

 there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself 	16.185877226570184

 but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice 	4.768139495053904

 and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground 	2.869290159916531

 more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed 	3.61902701017163

 she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so 	3.805300153998964

 could i expect it to be otherwise said she 	8.315340672533315

 she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself 	4.647899251172466

 and to him she had hardly courage to speak 	9.788915095304203

 she enquired after his sister but could do no more 	5.660790169577192

 it is a long time <title> bingley since you went away said <title> bennet 	4.274855802876574

 i began to be afraid you would never come back again 	12.153448733233608

 people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas 	4.811623894190781

 but however i hope it is not true 	13.831049364434277

 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away 	4.439077167018046

 miss lucas is married and settled 	7.4966725606614

 and one of my own daughters 	21.91441776353059

 indeed you must have seen it in the papers 	12.237961002889106

 it was in the times and the courier i know 	8.971299894933733

 though it was not put in as it ought to be 	7.105337367336979

 it was only said lately george wickham esq 	5.57954204930435

 to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing 	6.040737720406822

 it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it 	5.463119167169047

 did you see it 	13.463535905865779

 bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations 	10.319074187986507

 it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time <title> bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me 	4.812946894048013

 they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long 	4.526040293086829

 his regiment is there 	12.093234298317865

 for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars 	7.760490866282337

 thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves 	6.249014280122696

 elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at <title> darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat 	6.040766053213978

 it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before 	3.870037287789988

 and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 	5.7105834507175555

 a few weeks he believed 	10.433095882259083

 when you have killed all your own birds <title> bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on <title> bennet s manor 	4.788750752877205

 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you 	5.386589161606779

 elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion 	3.824935211821057

 at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion 	3.909705219219048

 the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them 	6.353312862835303

 their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover 	3.3709258999001013

 when first he came in he had spoken to her but little 	7.947247105802833

 but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention 	9.074544301975152

 he found her as handsome as she had been last year 	8.842828408497708

 as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty 	6.810070384519032

 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever 	7.507499329412934

 but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent 	7.295539953197266

 when the gentlemen rose to go away <title> bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time 	4.90357508722869

 you are quite a visit in my debt <title> bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned 	4.979988832443886

 i have not forgot you see 	5.391001790932778

 and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement 	6.2828703782772015

 they then went away 	11.017906387152827

 <title> bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day 	4.334888092759721

 but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year 	3.83522604152581

 chapter xii 	44.72575127815273

 as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits 	3.933684133835574

 <title> darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her 	5.166282601928156

 and why not to me 	16.251705843028077

 if he no longer cares for me why silent 	6.451900101768606

 teazing teazing man i will think no more about him 	7.621050911134097

 her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth 	4.351473001986228

 i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 	6.782815120038398

 it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance 	2.5297270637627585

 yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly 	6.85089252164913

 oh jane take care 	8.839686689749705

 my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now 	6.128380221049129

 i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever 	6.649266339831296

 they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday 	11.36081450096029

 on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn 	4.721982951785423

 and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time 	4.7992001191840865

 when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister 	4.657502247499212

 on entering the room he seemed to hesitate 	9.888409437669154

 but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided 	5.931467983129051

 he placed himself by her 	7.071051015650937

 elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend 	4.764635786007129

 though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 	4.570577456628662

 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast 	7.098707016959069

 for she was in no cheerful humour 	9.961656151050486

 <title> darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them 	8.351575803560712

 he was on one side of her mother 	9.439979302209478

 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage 	4.561399971582175

 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did 	4.023234605129913

 her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind 	4.42274149463879

 and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family 	5.375973565025792

 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together 	5.406482339975793

 that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance 	4.747434618298153

 anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil 	3.6157119910700217

 she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend 	6.095209716275512

 if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever 	7.080538842891951

 the gentlemen came 	20.03536392808321

 and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes 	6.894553797270654

 but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair 	3.6593727660244277

 and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined 	4.194615231433816

 we want none of them 	8.405590846450217

 do we 	115.47816495803974

 darcy had walked away to another part of the room 	7.933236830840053

 she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee 	4.727272771101629

 and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love 	3.3714599373821565

 is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman 	6.266260670460445

 there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself 	3.552789454717031

 and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still 	5.542298242910743

 yes she will remain there till christmas 	5.241897500083261

 and quite alone 	23.30184104150831

 have all her friends left her 	11.481293117449043

 <title> annesley is with her 	9.715430506400061

 the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks 	7.388050282351121

 she could think of nothing more to say 	5.894046677627045

 but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success 	6.100647192320909

 he stood by her however for some minutes in silence 	7.074356101793388

 and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away 	7.815573569741096

 when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 	3.448172141736564

 they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 	5.3544348568187266

 <title> bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper 	4.330476220261402

 well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day 	5.324154764951074

 i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you 	4.638584945620456

 the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 	5.13072857266625

 the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch 	2.9061692390658016

 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week 	5.000036704506093

 and even <title> darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done 	5.665607423045734

 and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 	5.81483469337775

 <title> long said so too for i asked her whether you did not 	4.375796547456588

 and what do you think she said besides 	7.847940364840562

 ah <title> bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last 	11.04337919968224

 i do think <title> long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously 	3.251478348914866

 <title> bennet in short was in very great spirits 	8.173716678590699

 she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last 	8.725372925148642

 and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals 	4.865934987763049

 it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth 	9.987391822704703

 the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other 	4.7857168333296345

 i hope we may often meet again 	6.663602682886949

 elizabeth smiled 	58.97024958612079

 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it 	3.829828807477816

 how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge 	5.286591289327893

 that is a question which i hardly know how to answer 	6.611827893035999

 we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 	4.818398997357109

 forgive me 	62.34745865230322

 and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante 	4.59882337641822

 a few days after this visit <title> bingley called again and alone 	6.555990983821383

 his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time 	5.174774620806419

 <title> bennet invited him to dine with them 	8.149560860658784

 but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 	3.6134072871967637

 next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky 	5.6354986343608

 he should be particularly happy at any time & <initial> & <initial>  	4.931801280402143

 and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 	4.720581163877112

 can you come to morrow 	17.925131278731925

 yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow 	9.822840222887235

 and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 	7.239312619243161

 he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed 	8.874845840117544

 in ran <title> bennet to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down 	4.986002022814025

 he is indeed 	19.247472042277376

 make haste make haste 	12.845867015367823

 here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown 	6.429505325310073

 never mind miss lizzy s hair 	5.018371160555479

 but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago 	4.094939292749882

 oh hang kitty what has she to do with it 	6.907012775767891

 come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear 	3.413964718494444

 but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 	6.492851027064356

 the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening 	5.714986798516968

 after tea <title> bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument 	4.775045523418914

 and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma 	4.279339712416047

 what do you keep winking at me for 	4.360216069600674

 nothing child nothing 	19.018739515449973

 i did not wink at you 	6.679446669111755

 she then sat still five minutes longer 	5.146694258619659

 but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room 	3.7571886732262425

 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it 	4.3783539751362355

 elizabeth was forced to go 	7.488128719299023

 we may as well leave them by themselves you know 	4.585425281912126

 kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room 	6.61407178807259

 elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room 	4.0491903922292005

 <title> bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual 	5.318612790188077

 bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter 	5.166809986128679

 and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter 	4.961496361488859

 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper 	6.5301517860212925

 and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and <title> bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 	4.282637307344588

 after this day jane said no more of her indifference 	7.814578583959391

 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley 	5.5855514358437475

 but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless <title> darcy returned within the stated time 	4.211687381584619

 seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence 	6.455768575902672

 bingley was punctual to his appointment 	11.18610710093347

 and he and <title> bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on 	8.444410804047088

 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 	6.038828893940961

 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence 	2.709620714458172

 and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 	5.60769827406182

 and in the evening <title> bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter 	6.009935540270615

 for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes 	5.650659919815674

 but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 	5.352235268940563

 on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation 	3.8095284783927568

 and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all 	3.113846061369626

 their situation was awkward enough 	6.783777077802045

 but her s she thought was still worse 	8.407416070412257

 not a syllable was uttered by either 	4.920801462638669

 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure 	4.405707817604744

 and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world 	5.281263362621475

 tis too much she added by far too much 	6.1776052621388216

 i do not deserve it 	7.905199315468754

 elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express 	2.6340226135805684

 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 	6.308829391886724

 but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present 	5.428110144842603

 i must go instantly to my mother 	9.538218988207163

 she cried 	105.83031029524602

 i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude 	6.76769270604469

 or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 	9.000059623512229

 and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 	5.134398116826048

 where is your sister 	16.33916779417275

 said he hastily as he opened the door 	7.199111451589846

 with my mother up stairs 	13.869598421165827

 she will be down in a moment i dare say 	7.630573200719089

 he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister 	4.799496693995188

 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 	6.208518835818963

 they shook hands with great cordiality 	9.095567920736306

 and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections 	8.730844283213006

 and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself 	3.3604634433494915

 it was an evening of no common delight to them all 	4.413738441290497

 the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever 	4.777309174769419

 kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon 	3.188625712647709

 <title> bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour 	3.483522956085575

 and when <title> bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was 	3.0749584117342823

 but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you 	7.002959632384397

 you will be a very happy woman 	14.629121220521531

 jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness 	8.020333563070535

 you are a good girl 	14.152087750316696

 he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled 	7.901945102060034

 i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 	5.932220682776592

 your tempers are by no means unlike 	5.619402618652918

 you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on 	4.779178936872152

 so easy that every servant will cheat you 	4.7175244466924715

 and so generous that you will always exceed your income 	6.25994343843715

 imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me  	4.158398982596376

 exceed their income my dear <title> bennet cried his wife what are you talking of 	5.0742436142404355

 why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more 	4.14483871118559

 then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night 	3.5274846405480096

 i knew how it would be 	7.0963710759370375

 i always said it must be so at last 	6.933242896768401

 i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together 	4.028883165208496

 oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten 	5.519534292529718

 at that moment she cared for no other 	4.293572186836552

 her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense 	6.458722988584333

 mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield 	9.304314119508575

 bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn 	4.902477056912495

 unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept 	3.42324078399596

 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister 	6.187988523245904

 for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else 	6.6418929738038175

 but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 	3.473892650526698

 in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her 	5.80807520785429

 he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible 	4.5018139086849445

 i suspected as much replied elizabeth 	9.78827970312774

 but how did he account for it 	4.882564921750216

 it must have been his sister s doing 	14.44040548079039

 but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again 	4.676743593842328

 good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard 	4.3584080559437375

 would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure 	4.435574795936527

 but it is to the credit of his modesty 	14.959679295752128

 this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities 	4.173302292345755

 i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane 	3.7834834591575137

 oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you 	4.203103186832751

 till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness 	6.505316260210154

 and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another <title> collins in time 	6.59740446632697

 <title> bennet was privileged to whisper it to <title> philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton 	5.735515251847106

 the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 	3.644451734037817

 chapter xiv 	44.72575127815273

 one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage 	5.244703607701562

 and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn 	3.4781766716622307

 it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 	6.205055540583912

 the horses were post 	11.985516412423621

 and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them 	4.428729355640129

 they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered 	4.629991842324217

 it was lady catherine de bourgh 	7.188150315753281

 they were of course all intending to be surprised 	9.345892540840468

 but their astonishment was beyond their expectation 	6.146463052217946

 and on the part of <title> bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt 	6.536826891587141

 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word 	4.693761529222908

 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made 	5.4848002880695015

 <title> bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness 	2.993995104974957

 after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet 	4.562103173712989

 that lady i suppose is your mother 	12.94183511087416

 elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 	4.444759679312528

 and that i suppose is one of your sisters 	13.296622846924395

 yes madam said <title> bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine 	9.541938521401331

 my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family 	4.16743234793816

 you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence 	5.027113368322424

 it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say 	3.4932313570461493

 but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas <initial> this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer 	4.499859075531853

 the windows are full west 	7.910509361249588

 <title> bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner 	5.5345188062950985

 and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <title> and <title> collins well 	4.10289734083959

 yes very well 	18.71451227156662

 i saw them the night before last 	6.352181753206576

 elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling 	6.3087497208272

 but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled 	6.3863889095290896

 <title> bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment 	4.702290622812533

 but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing 	4.163899063538236

 and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 	6.571749734423195

 i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company 	5.214918288636659

 go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks 	6.970759371033623

 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage 	11.386628554103153

 elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs 	4.079699041056906

 as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on 	3.489845875302145

 elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 	6.1777764726575715

 how could i ever think her like her nephew 	3.8922994551101384

 said she as she looked in her face 	20.276152173823153

 as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither 	5.594442421779721

 your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come 	4.5403536576876835

 indeed you are mistaken madam 	10.008969615669459

 i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here 	6.533333025513452

 miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with 	6.505962337902302

 but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so 	5.770134016966266

 my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it 	3.6311121020186743

 though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood 	8.510331668739997

 though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you 	5.246088349942045

 if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 	3.5629908826177785

 what could your ladyship propose by it 	5.030142256033654

 at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted 	5.25896343789578

 if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it 	10.05465404364147

 has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves 	5.361894696154441

 do you not know that such a report is spread abroad 	7.741185022130945

 i never heard that it was 	7.734825776701169

 and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it 	5.299034689959839

 you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer 	6.535977742908263

 this is not to be borne 	16.106609455429552

 has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage 	4.40598002805651

 your ladyship has declared it to be impossible 	6.988448314049604

 it ought to be so 	14.439021472271708

 but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 	4.0515497171318735

 you may have drawn him in 	5.813216944105215

 miss bennet do you know who i am 	11.80302717296661

 i have not been accustomed to such language as this 	4.081799563161094

 but you are not entitled to know mine  	10.475111091863333

 nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit 	5.9357792565690195

 let me be rightly understood 	6.5594191633011025

 <title> darcy is engaged to my daughter  	9.64916481263945

 now what have you to say 	12.72521277975467

 that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 	7.896233840121839

 lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 	6.029526989577793

 from their infancy they have been intended for each other 	6.759692439837011

 it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her <initial> while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends 	4.636474576442234

 to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh 	5.801741027608999

 are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy 	4.446022974361496

 have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin 	5.52344274715157

 yes and i had heard it before 	15.607875676152586

 but what is that to me 	11.954745015207386

 if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh 	4.84525285768103

 you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage 	4.550611956158657

 its completion depended on others 	6.755058535586462

 and if i am that choice why may not i accept him 	6.08356095152671

 because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it 	3.110036610031034

 yes miss bennet interest 	32.62299502777041

 for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 	5.874765156799732

 you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him 	3.3327629294616474

 your alliance will be a disgrace 	14.422462268478098

 your name will never even be mentioned by any of us 	5.619654589217154

 these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth 	4.770708722395275

 but the wife of <title> darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine 	5.765899330760703

 obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring 	6.35375531662414

 is nothing due to me on that score 	15.423887760343831

 let us sit down 	12.09004648838345

 you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose 	5.540606684152986

 nor will i be dissuaded from it 	5.424526631577128

 i have not been used to submit to any person s whi <title> i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment 	4.116616928838073

 that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable 	6.325295473214093

 but it will have no effect on me  	9.553622759118324

 hear me in silence 	21.34242306095088

 my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other 	5.380789631464267

 they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line 	7.3559318072097195

 and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families 	3.6239477892879397

 their fortune on both sides is splendid 	4.1597205631539

 they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses 	5.2338537143369175

 the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune 	4.0726561625761875

 is this to be endured but it must not shall not be 	7.92337152126059

 if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up 	5.497771205032592

 in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere 	4.431745787322988

 he is a gentleman 	11.533126910941952

 i am a gentleman s daughter 	7.001970083963436

 so far we are equal 	19.30639383026282

 you are a gentleman s daughter 	6.567204232263731

 but who was your mother 	11.440602484510682

 who are your uncles and aunts 	5.293392870684503

 whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you  	5.844572355494769

 tell me once for all are you engaged to him 	6.608990221224992

 lady catherine seemed pleased 	12.049041686801726

 and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement 	5.071841174800211

 i will make no promise of the kind 	10.148627497161387

 miss bennet i am shocked and astonished 	9.520203897806054

 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede 	9.216767256368636

 i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require 	5.9199443809110255

 and i certainly never shall give it 	6.262265010694629

 i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 	4.761003982510473

 your ladyship wants <title> darcy to marry your daughter 	7.6772268206353935

 but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable 	3.7128599789067294

 supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin 	5.526059849737456

 allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged 	5.338258525798117

 you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these 	5.450751419445908

 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell 	5.417773314007076

 but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 	4.2373699741860635

 i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject 	5.582285916210002

 not so hasty if you please 	11.09681262757378

 i have by no means done 	9.411868706811138

 to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add 	6.209042658903333

 i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement 	7.424972266311066

 i know it all 	11.440199564613938

 that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles 	6.243668238208365

 and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister 	10.846089054793413

 is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother 	8.316795259770881

 heaven and earth of what are you thinking 	7.315365437555149

 you have insulted me in every possible method 	6.634411783355016

 i must beg to return to the house 	6.5655995498284145

 and she rose as she spoke 	8.890390029990284

 lady catherine rose also and they turned back 	8.082159042376976

 her ladyship was highly incensed 	8.88396691891682

 you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody 	5.320402183668576

 lady catherine i have nothing farther to say 	8.046682212481361

 you know my sentiments 	11.961399622905978

 you are then resolved to have him 	9.97424209839562

 i have said no such thing 	13.061361361015127

 i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me 	3.6547012715781797

 it is well 	20.129177517155963

 you refuse then to oblige me 	6.906578564154945

 you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude 	2.8290867266501585

 you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world 	6.842309027914033

 neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance 	4.362639214780191

 no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with <title> darcy 	4.212219137643993

 and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn 	5.832088078562204

 and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well 	4.369228712987794

 i shall now know how to act 	6.691009300596816

 do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified 	5.480862106511248

 i came to try you 	15.73895346314173

 i hoped to find you reasonable 	12.19942889600187

 but depend upon it i will carry my point 	6.112790673698764

 in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet 	4.839141914097838

 i send no compliments to your mother 	6.260199078319606

 you deserve no such attention 	10.920359776880323

 i am most seriously displeased 	7.22896766299136

 elizabeth made no answer 	5.83937520613514

 and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself 	5.432549298938115

 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs 	6.613933251960638

 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 	6.24711136031695

 she did not choose it said her daughter she would go 	10.225052286802425

 she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you 	4.46855926804046

 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy 	11.11678071169929

 elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here 	8.075794067563729

 for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 	5.916057511735604

 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome 	3.65317457195022

 nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly 	5.609526040334688

 it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine 	4.480998284338726

 till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea 	5.18678828271969

 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 	4.089063605573484

 in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference 	4.499163949374316

 and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce 	7.966526232464252

 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do 	6.222034033160721

 with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning 	3.746367262826496

 if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him 	3.4040009044408492

 in that case he would return no more 	7.183489543456435

 lady catherine might see him in her way through town 	7.972642548195678

 if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it 	4.37274527519175

 i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy 	5.097491413031847

 if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all 	3.9845375033703587

 but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased <title> bennet s curiosity 	5.217897098614404

 and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject 	3.4865197549923277

 the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 	9.97876272085354

 lizzy said he i was going to look for you 	10.37257908120984

 come into my room 	9.224779476039991

 and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 	7.196924918963072

 it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine 	7.905408217411153

 and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations 	5.429971807310882

 she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down 	7.2529313841632534

 he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 	5.106678625003962

 i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony 	5.499415706808259

 let me congratulate you on a very important conquest 	8.371307884727411

 the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt 	5.073021737420817

 and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself 	4.93126885486419

 when her father continued you look conscious 	11.289182531041625

 young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these 	4.878623120130952

 but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer 	4.327431289840561

 this letter is from <title> collins 	11.203577871075447

 from <title> collins and what can he have to say 	8.026227936426054

 something very much to the purpose of course 	10.718685452157077

 he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases 	5.56137625973428

 i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point 	3.324902169615029

 what relates to yourself is as follows 	6.091809204827404

 having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of <title> collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority 	4.127247773992755

 your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land 	4.194293369656313

 this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage 	2.6042374760538554

 have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is 	3.6146318012663814

 but now it comes out 	6.088134936436748

 my motive for cautioning you is as follows 	4.954022686693061

 we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye 	7.573557418412974

 <title> darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you 	6.967491040065133

 could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related 	3.232618044920307

 <title> darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile 	4.179223724793836

 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 	4.2795616959625615

 are you not diverted 	18.928911280031564

 pray read on 	19.297999416777756

 after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion 	4.867049701667622

 when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 	4.362590883275249

 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 	5.228606961037445

 i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married 	3.0084296403218826

 it was an encouragement of vice 	5.3390145678105405

 and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it 	4.46356616742888

 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 	4.174691924294231

 but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it 	6.445287888548063

 for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn 	4.847328733148659

 oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted 	12.110489318457477

 but it is so strange yes that is what makes it amusing 	5.368708646684751

 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing 	7.23279235648501

 but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up <title> collins s correspondence for any consideration 	3.66549110637097

 nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law 	3.8171449293851247

 and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report 	4.8146253686613

 did she call to refuse her consent 	6.482524936113596

 to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh 	5.109809039277135

 and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it 	6.109237575463695

 it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried 	6.507877971987248

 her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of <title> darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much  	4.386564120011397

 chapter xvi 	44.72575127815273

 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected <title> bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit 	4.979414710920085

 the gentlemen arrived early 	12.471897736883394

 and before <title> bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out 	4.509341104191279

 it was agreed to 	9.905353076968424

 bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them 	5.030135389247721

 they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other 	5.500272336016865

 very little was said by either 	8.909930760934877

 kitty was too much afraid of him to talk 	8.274311518728496

 elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution 	3.6701201410272404

 and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone 	3.8449490007776226

 now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said <title> darcy i am a very selfish creature 	6.909694157505983

 and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your <initial> i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister 	4.582601222873343

 ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 	6.829853829729689

 were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express 	6.333501589984248

 i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness 	4.149001097056812

 i did not think <title> gardiner was so little to be trusted 	11.683027290322869

 you must not blame my aunt 	7.213918030873512

 lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter 	7.770494749602794

 and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars 	7.715105752043836

 let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them 	3.746425843594935

 if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone 	5.36750197123003

 that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny 	5.366697648559478

 but your family owe me nothing 	5.6532488275312565

 much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you  	7.333758554680623

 elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 	6.693827841165186

 after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me 	3.4358102489775018

 if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once 	4.669286653183528

 my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever 	3.851408921865764

 elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak 	5.46259502656854

 and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances 	3.4473726903284465

 the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before 	5.810885870256614

 and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 	5.143048204025987

 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him 	2.907649768252529

 but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable 	6.2094276518341385

 they walked on without knowing in what direction 	7.945574388358697

 and felt and said for attention to any other objects 	9.266460580051033

 dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give 	4.091691079326252

 but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise 	10.060102021605298

 it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before 	7.581181925380098

 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly 	5.040100271259897

 after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations 	5.304744660482457

 what did you say of me that i did not deserve 	10.104377219645349

 it was unpardonable 	27.907944360660643

 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth 	4.714881893447769

 the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable 	4.617593530908096

 but since then we have both i hope improved in civility 	5.371720892578932

 i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself 	6.08054581244745

 the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me 	5.506170399161688

 your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	4.537276152856829

 those were your words 	11.601168456727951

 you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me 	4.647881122788492

 though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice 	6.776153591568751

 i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 	4.872762925293396

 i can easily believe it 	9.316972032386717

 you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did 	4.056104210091036

 the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me 	5.534093439179143

 oh do not repeat what i then said 	9.360960524100546

 these recollections will not do at all 	9.894652834132696

 darcy mentioned his letter 	9.253816396864933

 did it said he did it soon make you think better of me 	7.155897729038987

 did you on reading it give any credit to its contents 	4.615853594339631

 there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again 	4.174503380180886

 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me 	3.1598257939420367

 the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard 	5.907970212452102

 but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies 	3.5876528122030336

 when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 	4.179821889903154

 the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so 	5.7447662160428665

 the adieu is charity itself 	5.995045044190794

 but think no more of the letter 	11.388575686479795

 the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten 	4.31052458468324

 you must learn some of my philosophy 	13.616963994833414

 think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure 	4.6025632793764375

 i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind 	6.819407068546146

 your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance 	4.369376110051101

 but with me it is not so 	12.615504665449402

 painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled 	4.491257692131569

 i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle 	4.707709557223159

 as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper 	4.982809330290357

 i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit 	4.521499112617611

 unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 	3.083574415149627

 and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous 	3.3706135939181427

 by you i was properly humbled 	12.781810375752958

 i came to you without a doubt of my reception 	11.275596222644305

 you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 	4.2903281438844525

 had you then persuaded yourself that i should 	5.644167001380233

 indeed i had 	22.81226197499097

 what will you think of my vanity 	17.087890071961848

 i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses 	8.989044820536895

 i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong 	4.077713091004386

 how you must have hated me after that evening 	6.158040337602141

 hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 	5.117115738542462

 i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me 	6.252753043737744

 you blamed me for coming 	10.509745886680054

 no indeed 	41.25700063866114

 i felt nothing but surprise 	19.342206681913762

 your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 	3.9316176812578103

 my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 	6.440162746562307

 and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to 	2.895507207996826

 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you 	4.47174064309374

 he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption 	5.517320558410333

 which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 	3.6229778194676783

 she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther 	5.312894176014403

 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home 	4.342438732888835

 what could become of <title> bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 	5.746955596303152

 darcy was delighted with their engagement 	15.218026166605478

 his friend had given him the earliest information of it 	6.897090892525309

 i must ask whether you were surprised 	8.159476221322889

 said elizabeth 	44.33481539353563

 when i went away i felt that it would soon happen 	7.557082343843562

 i guessed as much 	10.693796349575361

 and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case 	6.041855798229928

 on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago 	5.521264746441546

 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent 	5.451884149184465

 his surprise was great 	14.381360270954545

 he had never had the slightest suspicion 	12.983020530285101

 i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him 	4.948734781865557

 and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together 	4.999204024915

 did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring 	3.77237923574776

 from the former 	43.290824144964446

 and i was convinced of her affection 	21.400425217432414

 and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him 	5.63744999584408

 it did 	115.68963337306398

 bingley is most unaffectedly modest 	8.387116105110106

 i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him 	5.673603626237709

 i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him 	4.981417125355635

 he was angry 	29.366329345008015

 but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments 	5.229872648332464

 he has heartily forgiven me now 	5.391630630383465

 elizabeth longed to observe that <title> bingley had been a most delightful friend 	9.074970652451572

 so easily guided that his worth was invaluable 	6.094054782427498

 but she checked herself 	10.476412946964773

 in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house 	4.775490950665141

 in the hall they parted 	13.882227471704649

 my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to 	6.185560291015376

 was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table 	6.325532787203838

 she coloured as she spoke 	12.823412687657257

 but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth 	4.3917518960271895

 the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary 	6.715717243437273

 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent 	2.812562774632699

 and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so 	4.1009479576980175

 for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her 	3.415259270381858

 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known 	7.91536596621016

 she was aware that no one liked him but jane 	7.220686851767362

 and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 	5.258613480723874

 at night she opened her heart to jane 	5.153282547171779

 you are joking lizzy 	12.3310581639737

 this cannot be engaged to <title> darcy no no you shall not deceive me 	6.972855025904706

 i know it to be impossible 	11.100337563731548

 this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you 	3.990017525187543

 and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not 	3.3528224898467522

 yet indeed i am in earnest 	12.944301272720192

 i speak nothing but the truth 	13.285607106592712

 he still loves me and we are engaged 	8.452558960932048

 jane looked at her doubtingly 	9.920920302639217

 oh lizzy it cannot be 	5.612019340111951

 i know how much you dislike him 	10.24212755797022

 you know nothing of the matter 	10.807664524571683

 that is all to be forgot 	23.038764475891657

 perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now 	8.902447854886391

 but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable 	4.531139105701771

 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself 	6.523853203333988

 miss bennet still looked all amazement 	6.840330332288748

 elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth 	10.832911734150048

 good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane 	3.2622953354202218

 my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain 	7.498450781389146

 forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him 	7.413360594054493

 there can be no doubt of that 	7.279077483110696

 it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world 	4.945762522052288

 but are you pleased jane 	11.441404552273953

 shall you like to have such a brother 	17.20338774568791

 very very much 	29.24090131863246

 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight 	3.3620331950689315

 but we considered it we talked of it as impossible 	6.065796801485923

 and do you really love him quite well enough 	4.730449477830103

 oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection 	4.6044553114952524

 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do 	6.524965122903861

 oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all 	7.170585598937127

 what do you mean 	8.058539649474627

 why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley 	8.708241279159393

 i am afraid you will be angry 	7.906869637497751

 my dearest sister now be be serious 	4.911614029992911

 let me know every thing that i am to know without delay 	7.9635976130298864

 will you tell me how long you have loved him 	6.900834658398715

 it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began 	5.192116998280727

 another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect 	5.081824215037682

 and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment 	4.471251249924637

 when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish 	6.297973245057249

 now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself 	7.79470988585764

 i always had a value for him 	6.822902682310233

 were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him 	7.865276807008028

 but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me 	4.076565090297627

 but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me 	4.244251251158637

 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you 	7.399076386068226

 she had been unwilling to mention bingley 	9.615390056426335

 and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend 	5.116062320168186

 but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage 	5.366118054562873

 all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation 	5.0342060409247695

 i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company 	4.135325025027614

 what shall we do with him 	12.587121891427069

 lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way 	8.89742156571275

 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal 	3.5147547879654506

 as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information 	3.718723434861582

 and he soon afterwards said aloud <title> bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day 	4.303700368609867

 i advise <title> darcy and lizzy and kitty said <title> bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning 	4.902389121667845

 it is a nice long walk and <title> darcy has never seen the view 	5.679808460504834

 it may do very well for the others replied <title> bingley 	8.289370094750916

 but i am sure it will be too much for kitty 	7.04247542061864

 wont it kitty 	24.965604399904876

 kitty owned that she had rather stay at home 	7.427369084231219

 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented 	6.210789706773817

 as she went up stairs to get ready <title> bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 	4.815167702032709

 but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know 	5.912172436565563

 and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then 	4.520749720933314

 so do not put yourself to inconvenience 	11.211630374531937

 during their walk it was resolved that <title> bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening 	6.743131283338983

 elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother <initial> she could not determine how her mother would take it 	6.4447238345324855

 sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 	5.168770341473649

 but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense 	5.0920670952758655

 in the evening soon after <title> bennet withdrew to the library she saw <title> darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme 	6.582875437075333

 she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till <title> darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile 	4.624512851741023

 in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty 	4.7915150477822746

 and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library 	4.5337356327270495

 she was gone directly 	15.884128640832811

 her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious 	5.030552124488

 lizzy said he what are you doing 	9.675863008096742

 are you out of your senses to be accepting this man 	9.876696966321957

 have not you always hated him 	15.63086637187774

 how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give 	3.6597773125216215

 but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to <title> darcy 	6.038494794778484

 or in other words you are determined to have him 	7.320755798070323

 he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane 	3.418870446767142

 but will they make you happy 	6.280600661762089

 have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference 	6.111342059155572

 none at all 	24.965604399904876

 i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him 	6.785977709226433

 indeed he has no improper pride 	14.45058089565104

 he is perfectly amiable 	13.746921638136989

 you do not know what he really is 	7.864041536129413

 then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such ter <title> lizzy said her father i have given him my consent 	6.260944998741214

 i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him 	7.665657738959227

 but let me advise you to think better of it 	8.897230460517036

 i know your disposition lizzy 	8.705819874017324

 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband 	4.995538027417151

 unless you looked up to him as a superior 	12.094080270483715

 your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage 	4.868841537308501

 you could scarcely escape discredit and misery 	5.382049942996799

 my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 	3.981631271761879

 you know not what you are about 	11.57260525005996

 elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply 	4.484584903985083

 well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say 	6.497701897892479

 if this be the case he deserves you 	6.225049836564351

 i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy 	5.364933654844672

 to complete the favourable impression she then told him what <title> darcy had voluntarily done for lydia 	3.951759771621738

 he heard her with astonishment 	9.359184980004978

 this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing 	4.38168931157678

 made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better 	3.1961614058314756

 had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him 	6.031191494882494

 but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way 	4.046490092082069

 i shall offer to pay him to morrow 	7.089445157193698

 he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter 	5.814750869419407

 he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading <title> collins s letter 	3.525843292586446

 and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure 	4.452531064830383

 elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight 	5.856241693642431

 and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 	5.250030385765352

 every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away 	5.28792350435896

 there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 	4.573715898659934

 when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication 	6.261773224375017

 its effect was most extraordinary 	12.298017759234492

 nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard 	5.07220459142472

 though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 	6.803104915857721

 she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself 	3.8255790823669305

 good gracious lord bless me only think dear me <title> darcy who would have thought it and is it really true 	4.914376183636482

 oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all 	3.2743796203713127

 i am so pleased so happy 	5.16942025455009

 such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before 	3.6760069767494397

 i hope he will overlook it 	11.674117275014751

 dear dear lizzy 	25.658910937532212

 a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me 	3.8887269520484784

 i shall go distracted 	13.53955043358187

 this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away 	4.538161963793241

 but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her 	7.518399847449274

 my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence 	3.5032002561374016

 you must and shall be married by a special licence 	8.684715679025738

 but my dearest love tell me what dish <title> darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow 	6.9077903904037035

 and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for 	7.689686570636161

 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected 	5.658493837336248

 for <title> bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion 	5.386513717194697

 and <title> bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 	6.617054776270459

 i admire all my three sons in law highly said he 	3.7724978627202876

 wickham perhaps is my favourite 	9.747493449555689

 but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane <initial> chapter xviii 	5.136995756515248

 elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted <title> darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 	3.4698278711957324

 i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning 	5.3553142648763465

 but what could set you off in the first place 	6.622851983560292

 it is too long ago 	11.444091117748172

 i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun 	10.824039614686178

 my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not 	4.621220383254756

 now be sincere 	35.5911799074154

 did you admire me for my impertinence 	8.226833990187831

 for the liveliness of your mind i did 	7.631408665974303

 you may as well call it impertinence at once 	4.825358648011317

 the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention 	3.842569226845373

 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone 	4.229577736174163

 i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them  	4.8048155254384115

 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it 	6.313261694202737

 but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just 	3.555615701848995

 and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 	2.7757219229402135

 and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 	4.629313486770904

 to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love 	4.559846867776037

 was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield 	5.497945980345223

 dearest jane who could have done less for her 	7.980430167740804

 but make a virtue of it by all means 	6.318893163749157

 my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible 	3.5538960156594066

 and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be 	3.4092015052792486

 and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 	4.18204028255326

 what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here 	3.8938609157000736

 why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me 	5.931189281379809

 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement 	5.283459723921156

 but i was embarrassed 	17.43895254950237

 and so was <initial> you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 	5.616591282850547

 a man who had felt less might 	9.314997215426052

 how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself 	7.074113030318805

 i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 	4.0344100024505

 too much i am afraid 	32.99321238367353

 for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject 	4.048243698801597

 this will never do 	19.68443000585451

 you need not distress yourself 	8.082372995630676

 the moral will be perfectly fair 	12.804407928445771

 lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts 	3.4105817941593153

 i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your <initial> my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing 	5.746928184564534

 lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use 	4.916362186754083

 was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed 	4.943543046331516

 or had you intended any more serious consequence 	6.035132987568189

 my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me 	7.5734022893128365

 my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made 	5.564549356101102

 shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her 	5.084155916073693

 i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth 	4.624201432893403

 but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly 	6.9578522225152355

 and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did 	4.622947176953779

 but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected 	5.801001435426521

 from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with <title> darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered <title> gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars 	3.7658852315661377

 but to say the truth i was too cross to write 	10.793623506485876

 you supposed more than really existed 	10.06626655734134

 but now suppose as much as you chuse 	5.805468442945956

 give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err 	3.149379544927186

 you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 	4.782665807756032

 i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes 	4.9860138798370395

 how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful 	5.93369452296125

 we will go round the park every day 	5.403742451952306

 i am the happiest creature in the world 	5.234552171901061

 perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice 	6.735032543765059

 i am happier even than jane 	6.246258854501623

 she only smiles i laugh 	8.90808136088495

 your s & <initial> <title> darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style 	5.66741857475829

 and still different from either was what <title> bennet sent to <title> collins in reply to his last 	6.330359647035746

 dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations 	5.680390245210936

 elizabeth will soon be the wife of <title> darcy 	5.527731567594732

 console lady catherine as well as you can 	13.01003224231959

 but if i were you i would stand by the nephew 	6.318072420405289

 he has more to give 	13.581385269941723

 your s sincerely & <initial> miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere 	5.527045523363374

 jane was not deceived but she was affected 	15.928432391864133

 and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 	3.8933500044430276

 the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it 	3.6881618199310346

 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 	3.882085374842377

 before any answer could arrive from <title> collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge 	4.191154002418564

 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 	6.556160736758086

 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 	4.494715302108567

 at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw <title> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband 	5.112825726119344

 he bore it however with admirable calmness 	5.2480305633689674

 he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st 	3.2848973388329656

 james s with very decent composure 	4.922411770345918

 if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight 	4.6103980567099825

 and though <title> philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar 	5.584744836184221

 nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant 	6.816985755662089

 elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification 	5.652518421780524

 and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future 	5.0643981480372755

 and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley 	4.01934613463335

 i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life 	4.6804063802911475

 though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly 	4.477771767811149

 his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do 	3.9059070493045454

 he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected 	7.1946823117474725

 <title> bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth 	6.083873297782296

 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart 	4.461861975595625

 he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other 	3.6339068901624874

 kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters 	6.094843412859329

 in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great 	5.015184945967042

 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid 	2.5224328970778447

 from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though <title> wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going 	5.173428909791443

 mary was the only daughter who remained at home 	4.8630749867567955

 and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <title> bennet s being quite unable to sit alone 	5.0900208078631595

 mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit 	5.223650962027314

 and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance 	6.033101112349379

 as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters 	4.80982518358995

 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her 	3.09177536357568

 and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune 	4.765159496093666

 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished 	5.376221701310105

 the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy 	5.911033871253238

 if you love <title> darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy 	8.077257418087383

 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 	3.8506455988671995

 but however do not speak to <title> darcy about it if you had rather not 	11.29725394577683

 yours & <initial> as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind 	4.746425320590825

 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support 	4.065958719345446

 their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme 	5.203313322831472

 they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought 	3.7254243055451775

 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference 	4.933243428585207

 her s lasted a little longer 	7.723820322529572

 and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her 	5.247682517550683

 though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession 	4.321389949497494

 lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath 	4.497294386663217

 and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone 	4.602458311145548

 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage 	6.3166896603601455

 but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment 	3.449679195555146

 was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth 	2.327015187572159

 pemberley was now georgiana s home 	12.624766183157723

 and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see 	6.8628324528492355

 they were able to love each other even as well as they intended 	8.0234977650972

 georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth 	6.620217806241521

 though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother 	4.639555037824576

 he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry 	3.2790456348948434

 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way 	5.733246032735932

 by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 	4.3693501183764925

 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew 	6.929039484312247

 and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end 	3.6126241111347

 and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself 	5.545629592995797

 and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 	4.50156764922229

 with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate ter <title> darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them 	8.547918084618063

 and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them 	3.9823570818011125
