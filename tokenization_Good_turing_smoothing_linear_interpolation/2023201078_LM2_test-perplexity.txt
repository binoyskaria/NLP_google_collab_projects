 them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married 	 675.9012399430547

 of <title> darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well 	 84.5808414359827

 but we are none of us consistent 	 690.8152183972508

 he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia 	 857.4963343526484

 it cannot last long 	 442.0804291661037

 i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled 	 226.8370086246181

 charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley 	 308.02505153723445

 i do not believe she often sees such at home 	 270.63447661161786

 in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley 	 200.0401586311451

 lord how i should like to be married before any of you 	 133.63552246460307

 after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained 	 780.5381748014848

 i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer 	 323.66544264363114

 but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 	 361.88558393198457

 i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to <title> darcy 	 209.27790428715107

 he found her as handsome as she had been last year 	 154.6145797667445

 caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one 	 1470.0300506906744

 this letter is from <title> collins 	 427.9799581398234

 and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked 	 296.0243556738877

 my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which <title> gardiner s behaviour laid them all under 	 453.43532630504

 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for <title> collins was only a clergyman 	 234.66448718312236

 i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner 	 648.888755515137

 they had therefore many acquaintance in common 	 508.4726255863317

 in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either 	 196.18955737286527

 is this to be endured but it must not shall not be 	 128.85905181023145

 charlotte herself was tolerably composed 	 1291.175250038919

 as <title> gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that <title> bennet came from it 	 196.29783465614503

 i have not been accustomed to such language as this 	 256.687051988623

 at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected 	 309.8920277643549

 i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 	 310.67002403831185

 since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head 	 455.6890266234034

 and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so 	 211.31330232627116

 it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill 	 594.0706371775141

 as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery 	 403.42742874491626

 if <title> darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice 	 408.4119613763606

 but it is returned she 	 144.55206352240336

 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever 	 512.3283586665667

 you may depend on it replied the other for <title> nicholls was in meryton last night 	 599.9392682151228

 yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say <title> darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable 	 694.3227473759565

 cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious 	 344.542656294727

 <initial> <number> through <number>  	 405.81415495001886

 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter 	 174.12796878755879

 he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women 	 381.42785508620705

 and she rose as she spoke 	 250.3826258477454

 in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce 	 590.064339193065

 tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits 	 452.7918603577179

 and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to <title> hill and the two housemaids 	 300.74548148594727

 though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here 	 478.57718478243885

 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper 	 248.8475315115771

 but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 	 118.77965066360103

 jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention 	 523.0045836006054

 the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house 	 268.53813877002534

 that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 	 178.09960023340602

 she enquired after his sister but could do no more 	 841.7952445820601

 and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 	 545.5814506049013

 any place would do of about three or four hundred a year 	 391.2434809203874

 but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult 	 237.17527909765678

 intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done 	 265.160829137062

 said her sister 	 79.0801576465623

 compliments always take you by surprise and me never 	 562.9143744877888

 when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject 	 697.2931026688811

 she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther 	 509.59325408486364

 your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together 	 316.33868901657405

 but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame 	 601.3898014114409

 it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace 	 184.91788417059905

 give me farther particulars 	 1281.8610128181842

 four or five thousand a year 	 42.43802373273623

 there was another reason too for her opposition 	 300.5999446050336

 the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him 	 356.87901955735646

 in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her 	 699.2530103929714

 and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand 	 521.3085843604472

 and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome 	 584.4788553240111

 i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements 	 351.401907490397

 you have insulted me in every possible method 	 218.2435972704347

 oh but the gentlemen will have <title> bingley s chaise to go to meryton 	 374.0281258572583

 and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts 	 436.0787185390986

 therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care 	 459.04563001242246

 my dear father i congratulate you 	 96.46310238618881

 colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton 	 672.983567105519

 if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs <number>  	 286.89655072099913

 they must have seen them together for ever 	 170.7336951028841

 miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed 	 506.1361798176087

 i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you 	 106.62766977098964

 <title> bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment 	 161.9062532220273

 and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men 	 278.8473654096483

 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 	 503.4850193546689

 lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten 	 279.57790106982895

 her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their char <title> at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready 	 529.6297787998874

 no lizzy that is what i do not choose 	 199.50462685160545

 her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire 	 396.6969927004004

 did you on reading it give any credit to its contents 	 652.4651282280604

 lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her 	 257.8465406988551

 does your charge give you much trouble 	 1213.8799610502874

 the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return <title> bennet s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner 	 203.43642332300647

 and <title> bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 	 208.05337445797142

 i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 	 390.8449926523125

 but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this 	 716.0308775207345

 elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts 	 341.2227375205893

 and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth 	 361.0982721478233

 she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her 	 487.0104507575515

 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged <title> collins s conversation to herself 	 361.9180877298997

 he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther 	 658.328678130718

 the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter 	 618.4595741013421

 and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise 	 203.18275637730298

 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 	 213.1071546447134

 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy 	 328.19362642884136

 i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady 	 44.579343621452225

 there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper 	 468.69403267645856

 it may do very well for the others replied <title> bingley 	 386.6872524839875

 what do you keep winking at me for 	 314.1056114489248

 mary was the only daughter who remained at home 	 580.036895626103

 the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave 	 816.910906440389

 i have no such injuries to resent 	 274.5025160498829

 my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour 	 265.5871182944459

 and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 	 689.0717021185601

 the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity 	 502.340043171963

 how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 	 360.6999725012559

 but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist 	 472.24660021191403

 let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions 	 549.6579191868583

 by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 	 390.3076820815988

 not one party or scheme or any thing 	 343.46996107170287

 and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close 	 634.9594409155412

 from their infancy they have been intended for each other 	 521.833023258197

 i cannot understand it 	 172.26867641627453

 jane certainly could not come back 	 443.9209348963897

 she will drop the acquaintance entirely 	 521.4036269409635

 i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places 	 593.9537327709038

 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you 	 237.92740388375807

 every thing being settled between them <title> darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home 	 414.92726569878556

 at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted 	 179.98067607291642

 you see how continually we are engaged there 	 484.2417687643506

 but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible 	 613.86442402242

 i never saw such a woman 	 32.41922185382217

 his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go 	 252.60123622827047

 but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me 	 547.0300382438156

 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met 	 531.0532948746093

 i am afraid <title> darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes 	 375.8925224046376

 and <title> bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would 	 218.80675963073244

 the comfort to her of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression 	 637.3446201760823

 shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her 	 402.93482144698595

 i am said he with a firm voice 	 183.91916098847224

 in a few days <title> bingley returned <title> bennet s visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library 	 288.6126804276227

 and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together 	 70.05594875271912

 these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth 	 628.6137298830361

 the other is miss de bourgh 	 111.43946745374126

 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when <title> jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light 	 524.6994081000543

 and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene 	 290.0275047807662

 i am glad of one thing that he comes alone 	 230.04618471227204

 but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded 	 210.76025368631187

 can you deny that you have done it 	 145.0842547226278

 to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town 	 134.86964019316164

 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming 	 280.07677757249235

 i hope at least he has not deceived us 	 392.47647117760835

 but what said she after a pause can have been his motive 	 251.5200743025757

 oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune 	 491.729511339818

 <title> gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder 	 361.31954317147824

 he was on one side of her mother 	 99.31646366767303

 and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling 	 256.08719428166626

 how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there 	 138.39321704961426

 or me either for that matter 	 974.5127153782678

 do you talk by rule then while you are dancing 	 527.4853868721823

 and if i was her i would not have put up with it 	 189.16373821439612

 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived 	 322.8984954524373

 you judge very properly said <title> bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy 	 495.9280539094285

 kitty owned that she had rather stay at home 	 634.8532760912897

 and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry 	 584.4891915380525

 he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention 	 134.6295378620107

 they agreed that <title> bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct 	 334.0429850075961

 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother 	 394.8498107069588

 colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head 	 197.79884052313759

 jane was not happy 	 345.41239941324045

 and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side 	 187.0573803582164

 that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him 	 400.4351002516304

 such was miss lucas s scheme 	 210.70495344490172

 they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea 	 135.35232083455273

 unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring 	 480.62582474877803

 i speak nothing but the truth 	 364.5719366615738

 but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield 	 347.21174169041103

 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart 	 537.1419693048916

 though it was not put in as it ought to be 	 121.96886744543261

 if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it 	 372.67429286575674

 seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence 	 912.4144249141146

 oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both 	 608.4791228178436

 elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view 	 525.6920751204951

 good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe 	 409.6609003025716

 you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him 	 406.0921202508043

 what could your ladyship propose by it 	 592.6684464623104

 that is to say you had given your permission 	 513.5763819162112

 after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it 	 398.8629792252549

 but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given 	 760.2845549281606

 then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such ter <title> lizzy said her father i have given him my consent 	 285.36294310192056

 the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke 	 452.38368921887644

 but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement 	 360.41076159056325

 on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower 	 351.84782139011594

 your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings 	 959.8349895722023

 <title> reynolds could interest her on no other point 	 688.0484502316887

 wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look 	 1047.7391448580688

 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 	 153.073695402504

 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself 	 174.17878449443887

 and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals 	 547.6108112029575

 elizabeth silently attended her 	 843.8889722836122

 and in her postscript it was added that if <title> bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well 	 414.0827387268965

 you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters 	 643.4075164265619

 sir william staid only a week at hunsford 	 358.24718541704095

 engraved for no 	 1000.0

 neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place 	 596.199645317345

 <title> gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject 	 450.1975394765542

 however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were 	 1077.3113997945266

 he must write his own sermons 	 536.1661198680572

 though <title> bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage 	 182.87730014190706

 her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else <title> darcy was condemned as the worst of men 	 548.0873932926729

 to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 	 296.8106968583912

 lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself 	 601.9359542699882

 i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require 	 319.24106285901615

 and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing 	 477.25643373331775

 that is rather singular 	 223.28592491119966

 and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces 	 217.98198029023393

 he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her 	 303.07388712583764

 and with many men i dare say it succeeds 	 161.1726850101625

 <title> bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 	 298.2887736785815

 elizabeth was in agonies 	 280.2017393722561

 said jane 	 174.47741269564904

 but i always speak what i think 	 147.78017766202646

 and pray what is the result 	 59.161875978936784

 they were therefore to go 	 328.455889083877

 there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning 	 186.20228944619095

 what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side 	 703.4051957792175

 and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing 	 495.0346734000034

 on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion 	 221.20705243580858

 i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely 	 300.3376403430145

 it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return 	 390.4645081340412

 they walked on without knowing in what direction 	 404.9248659359366

 said she 	 108.60643271003947

 i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you 	 446.1749598143093

 well then supposing them to be in london 	 197.0036151482595

 and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 	 471.24004698445265

 pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe 	 897.1057418784304

 is it true 	 219.18649286685584

 how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind 	 325.1233713520285

 but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject 	 633.1545413351321

 when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty 	 458.4069339444638

 i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him 	 146.18128582239981

 but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it 	 174.24996858499165

 again she read on 	 1176.4482683098545

 it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey 	 433.620497940455

 it was not their wish to force her communication 	 162.76634781625148

 lizzy declares she will not have <title> collins and <title> collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy 	 140.23981291066656

 but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure 	 437.3774310117295

 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either <title> hurst or miss bingley 	 949.1143887664252

 chapter xviii 	 2731.396376852312

 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 	 911.4059403752179

 his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham 	 327.52898264925204

 the next was in these words 	 132.10500030359296

 you know not what you are about 	 94.14381806231707

 a lively imagination soon settled it all 	 772.1737324344855

 and pray what sort of guardians do you make 	 220.82654460571794

 and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house 	 125.34578364797952

 of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant 	 167.2550847356601

 miss bingley was engrossed by <title> darcy her sister scarcely less so 	 259.14013508976296

 with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured <title> wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family 	 338.4759738364063

 so much the better 	 39.59036859116654

 chapter xiii 	 2731.396376852312

 and one of my own daughters 	 99.99985606425902

 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 	 232.48639747331438

 her face is too thin 	 681.5366339738661

 oh yes 	 216.14931322517498

 but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 	 263.1146241637599

 and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 	 370.33468422343736

 jane now came up 	 1036.106711425331

 but he had still at intervals a kind listener in <title> philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin 	 512.1954880138296

 if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh 	 234.60429102289734

 to pemberley therefore they were to go 	 229.36607148786533

 it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor 	 586.7358366323429

 do you certainly leave kent on saturday 	 489.52612277223824

 when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication 	 207.55601522699092

 elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded 	 461.47148325952475

 you could scarcely escape discredit and misery 	 595.561552838367

 i never saw a more promising inclination 	 295.5718711145956

 and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls 	 510.8945292133844

 to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth 	 591.8855748846809

 here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse 	 1206.8451880351781

 not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night 	 629.3781154924419

 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly 	 1015.1248544328892

 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened 	 154.28373814457362

 its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet 	 961.2355848812658

 but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe <title> bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent 	 543.9471717132212

 then turning to <title> bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon 	 733.4979806644321

 from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with <title> darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered <title> gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars 	 471.2133636128293

 i have already told her so once by your desire 	 515.8625006035463

 and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as <title> collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh 	 255.7053602765151

 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear 	 572.771503318932

 my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing 	 226.51241214634692

 jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart 	 498.4426508623394

 through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 	 348.6141383782669

 chapter vii 	 2731.396376852312

 but this would be nothing if you really liked him 	 620.8384503038661

 all was joy and kindness 	 461.2859561895822

 when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses 	 239.38939382918127

 but i suppose you had no opportunity 	 119.34648097738655

 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility 	 430.98223232299745

 that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating 	 239.46718404757874

 i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other 	 263.19708904224376

 and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room 	 257.0856544736777

 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance 	 343.2023910939095

 and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned 	 638.0506622608737

 i desire you will stay where you are 	 83.23185656068732

 oh said she i heard you before 	 725.4361941556269

 where does discretion end and avarice begin 	 1198.10456784522

 stay where you are 	 458.4900163016869

 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else 	 220.85264022269286

 you mentioned two instances 	 695.7319070830215

 i will have no reserves from you  	 157.79179697373178

 say that urgent business calls us home immediately 	 1000.0

 oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid 	 442.9719631473968

 did you see it 	 135.38541522268972

 and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves 	 211.83958413407333

 untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless 	 1000.0

 and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married 	 421.79581162928577

the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice by jane austen edited by <initial> <initial> robert william chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever 	 25.103023028204678

 they have known her much longer than they have known me 	 502.65559122486053

 chapter <initial> within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate 	 359.87124622017313

 her reflections were in general satisfactory 	 450.0333737418659

 though we can never be what we once were to each other 	 203.92303783078935

 to <title> and <title> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 	 224.97919179614067

 has she any family 	 389.42410478647963

 they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds 	 526.2864818973239

 and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn 	 422.2415311430019

txt or 42671 <number>  	 1000.0

 but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day 	 265.82016840803914

 oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 	 479.9956448042232

 every body said how well she looked 	 282.78866142355395

 they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other 	 620.150877968555

 <title> hurst looked at her with astonishment 	 175.35741982897983

 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 	 339.1222547794518

 you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created  	 401.1821456017173

 <title> darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found 	 357.65106196656404

 it must be so while he retains the use of his reason 	 212.32345164774026

 elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances 	 463.6982095529923

 and before <title> bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out 	 502.6249569147578

 a few weeks he believed 	 199.62361196835613

 <title> collins made his declaration in form 	 434.82693230036796

 i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend 	 297.78239689747716

 i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible 	 306.8151230087319

 and their conversation which had been passing while <title> and <title> gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party 	 156.6760817354963

 for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power 	 256.0637566139372

 we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice 	 476.97178053636634

 she was teazed by <title> collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others 	 172.95319830615378

 miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room 	 284.14413263305704

 she is a great fool for going away if she liked him 	 343.4155594081423

 and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire 	 398.1946150776077

 how are you all 	 175.2270672914618

 nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been 	 114.66204725492656

 society i own is necessary to me 	 1406.7783382490238

 with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content 	 322.44907511420024

 and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country 	 251.16445251397985

 i had often seen him in love before 	 142.71160235014318

 she must own that she was tired of great houses 	 541.74634124248

 elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes 	 350.7414714428272

 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them 	 128.78268115623052

 she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown 	 296.45611163724925

 but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book 	 726.5012105335999

 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character 	 365.6205601699001

 he heard her with astonishment 	 225.70598505514295

 but consider your daughters 	 689.7777991022313

 for she was in no cheerful humour 	 125.08577903705203

 indeed <title> darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear 	 487.1596749908761

 if he no longer cares for me why silent 	 591.3335073236881

 louisa you will not mind my waking <title> hurst 	 489.48851526144693

 they then went away 	 150.53210786039216

 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth 	 297.9739926418553

 and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 	 370.03623678677263

 and thither also went <title> wickham undoubtedly by design 	 765.333460729161

 i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when <title> denny comes back from town 	 468.4605747983915

 i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient 	 443.249937930288

 allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer 	 188.25414155708447

 i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older 	 290.2733044689471

 <title> collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable 	 322.1860095387418

 it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate 	 345.46210338423293

 would <title> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it 	 940.8381088752344

 miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place 	 385.4275292797013

 miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with 	 153.55550644689356

 they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn 	 518.9025366662838

 but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever 	 539.3863169667179

 how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful 	 400.70422231287966

 then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 	 294.23039337794063

 their father was in neither 	 513.7905469934883

 and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 	 182.64058579133663

 there is nothing else to be done 	 98.79965110550113

 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 	 430.44614750750003

 it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like 	 453.75093035063094

 what a delightful library you have at pemberley <title> darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations 	 253.31194246286947

 pray what is your age 	 291.33299801136866

 in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost 	 339.01269317516426

 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for <title> collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it 	 274.90934645701367

 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them 	 109.07247570755005

 he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself 	 283.7371028723912

 how can it affect them 	 531.2657490753003

 with a book he was regardless of time 	 505.7804974916166

 if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all 	 250.95764502740133

 i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear 	 271.8988081992398

 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to <title> bennet 	 209.0621951488303

 respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever 	 1000.0

 not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself 	 541.0763832210381

 elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them 	 573.8348579850408

 then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet 	 995.1317622884859

 could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife 	 325.5335736032407

 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room 	 469.1192789295519

 attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham 	 1000.0

 it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was 	 241.08743797665352

 and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 	 365.6501859188997

 miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure 	 390.6129784280558

 but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 	 317.04954351469513

 elizabeth longed to observe that <title> bingley had been a most delightful friend 	 102.08376935163714

 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party 	 292.016257742854

 good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton 	 645.8184278514065

 the business was therefore soon settled 	 337.4555171534627

 she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne <initial> anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn 	 370.1298451837592

 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant 	 255.38002526258393

 they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line 	 679.242067918811

 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 	 924.1380381990073

 every time they met it was more decided and remarkable 	 493.17244303801317

 indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them 	 419.9595047718621

 and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry 	 179.15278188057874

 but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here 	 580.9040726638758

 his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards <title> darcy with a very expressive smile 	 387.98363586542405

 she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted 	 337.03409028018166

 she liked him too little to care for his approbation 	 484.2792085814607

 and quite alone 	 448.28282889770213

 as soon as ever <title> bingley comes my dear said <title> bennet you will wait on him of course 	 142.71057150017896

 sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty 	 404.9906469635074

 his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured 	 520.8890512392047

 on this point she was soon satisfied 	 65.10835508146852

 i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 	 394.14385314807606

 he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family 	 280.7352162863404

 but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 	 383.32851203204615

 and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 	 213.57951424988408

 when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley 	 564.5412335733166

 the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd 	 787.4200280548752

 and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point 	 248.61967860959118

 this will never do 	 557.6607407888333

 i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it 	 280.3656999683974

 i am talking of possibilities charles 	 345.095514007358

 and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page 	 445.86872766537044

 elizabeth made no objection 	 112.17787039852432

 good bye 	 1287.5926001204243

 contact the foundation as set forth in section <number> below 	 157.71700995626563

 it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers 	 142.94881986418554

 and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty 	 468.38144695480736

 she will follow wherever lydia leads 	 521.4036269409635

 but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 	 263.8883515788756

 after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight 	 476.02562794543326

 no i cannot talk of books in a ball room 	 400.37275834048694

 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 	 382.84143334349585

 the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them 	 607.1930736682073

 that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting 	 600.2277469247994

 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 	 199.88376842182652

 she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever 	 413.60143128183773

 lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care 	 1041.9411088221616

 and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room 	 78.83680949886144

 <title> darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her 	 273.9368748363124

 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy 	 134.68006019370293

 and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas 	 242.50926330191967

 and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections 	 395.9457408912632

 chapter iv 	 2731.396376852312

 does that young lady know <title> darcy 	 540.5919532136207

 but still he would be her husband 	 246.34551323253802

 and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room 	 531.4974263678621

 when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him 	 187.14181194705816

 <title> bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday 	 270.8611844508055

 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with <title> wickham 	 445.60533901424515

 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents 	 338.2899980309638

 and she told me that it was certain true 	 79.13427581158285

 though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see <title> bingley in consequence of it before they did 	 223.53279491951946

 and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see 	 310.2814591211982

 but no one looked more amused than <title> bennet himself while his wife seriously commended <title> collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man 	 339.0581974264985

 it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 	 375.35442293612243

 chapter ii 	 2731.396376852312

 elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact 	 147.27465340700707

 and now we are better 	 287.9044692291639

 he wrote last week to hurry my return 	 841.1749019528339

 said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with 	 523.6990438970828

 <initial> <number>  	 164.68512835779802

 my father bears it better 	 415.6360945333079

 well lizzy said <title> bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s 	 361.40408350489383

 imprudent as a marriage between <title> wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland 	 384.1698182308734

 and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance 	 687.0389384686971

 it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 	 199.8670029138845

 that is all settled 	 93.65174595542062

 jane was not deceived but she was affected 	 336.60402645318686

 if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it 	 364.8691817568827

 and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good 	 343.4189012482923

 so easily guided that his worth was invaluable 	 928.0966994121253

 <title> bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton 	 262.9564992182397

 ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid 	 661.0224330709248

 she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when 	 126.98468345937108

 but <title> darcy can please where he chuses 	 341.3961674133712

 and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball 	 263.0843316169202

 chapter xii 	 2731.396376852312

 perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth 	 405.89255455398694

 it is impossible 	 60.71630600720271

 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 	 619.1449424923661

 it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining 	 255.11648856217485

 <title> darcy walked off 	 214.3674467690169

 he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend 	 471.26383797072623

 oh yes 	 216.14931322517498

 on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn 	 246.9632044297333

 elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between <title> wickham and herself 	 115.79343736310571

 the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which <title> collins had promised 	 377.750563345382

 oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable 	 151.5834535838465

 my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge 	 644.6984524049274

 for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them 	 130.1549206536021

 and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone 	 516.9877430032783

 and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite 	 692.2685101635278

 i advise <title> darcy and lizzy and kitty said <title> bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning 	 350.47842790412665

 darcy mentioned his letter 	 940.7216108270381

 the part which i acted is now to be explained 	 768.8243019207491

 the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified 	 479.49643207006545

 very well and this offer of marriage you have refused 	 265.6353040232026

 they have at least that advantage 	 314.07953583250816

 i know your disposition lizzy 	 395.28038963135174

 they stood for some time without speaking a word 	 197.71721562561822

 chapter xvii 	 2731.396376852312

 but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas <initial> this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer 	 195.08250186122103

 her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more 	 322.5067544893832

 then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners 	 424.19143356504225

 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy 	 660.4885719345398

 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 	 1000.0

 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning 	 85.78111175468574

 copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change 	 1000.0000000000013

 it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family 	 102.70765900948169

 and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did 	 319.1744346422771

 elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time 	 251.33411555635612

 his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity 	 418.3076515549987

 that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance 	 207.1162542748389

 with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises 	 860.508511172269

 that is a question which <title> darcy only can answer 	 91.52043764125273

 your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	 128.9678727291542

 i beg you will not go 	 53.64369371792827

 i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings 	 314.20729260537547

 she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 	 579.0453088267578

 and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn 	 258.61441399670804

 <title> wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia 	 388.2687765459179

 the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow 	 294.83113494777376

 i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it 	 625.4759693556322

 hopeless of seeing him before 	 199.2827133821602

 but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you 	 127.28087321217896

 when we met at pemberley 	 978.5278583760974

 he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was 	 135.1516913478076

 but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it 	 160.31994318708342

 <title> wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself 	 532.0272770881031

 his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative 	 466.5896828145954

 <title> darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet 	 302.38966214664214

 their manners are not equal to his 	 451.0435043761492

 his character is thereby complete 	 439.59094812648556

 had you then persuaded yourself that i should 	 397.56655760213675

 i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present 	 289.67731139998153

 and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece <initial> it is <title> wickham s intention to go into the regulars 	 298.3357230683477

 i will speak to her about it myself directly 	 444.81408948803363

 i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 	 157.8998887794424

 that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to <title> darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance 	 251.7460493863137

 jane was beyond competition her favourite child 	 544.7448074111268

 james s with very decent composure 	 731.2011292328476

 in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth 	 466.03756725280573

 perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me 	 1199.8477456963392

 but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 	 945.8605514703058

 illustration matlock pride and prejudice a novel 	 210.12669499695664

 i do not know the particulars but i know very well that <title> darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 	 196.1862373976746

 and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked <title> darcy before they had known any thing of the matter 	 233.58060252102607

 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband 	 581.6167492003618

 and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 	 213.82543687337653

 or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 	 434.91536822126085

 but you are always giving her the preference 	 304.97756277410133

 he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively 	 297.4981734720417

 after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel <initial> came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through 	 651.9509965939262

 the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention 	 418.79341337908403

 there was no want of discourse 	 227.00426887458616

 after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations 	 724.5442181389873

 they have none of them much to recommend them replied he 	 354.8481886431485

 <title> collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society 	 153.60201176962457

 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman 	 240.614744955113

 excuse my interference 	 3158.1797779010762

 i shall never forget her appearance this morning 	 218.01906478507095

 my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction 	 400.1008253701089

 i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me 	 625.4759693556322

 you are severe on us 	 108.21057761763163

 i do not believe a word of it my dear 	 38.20968345454584

 thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry 	 509.2072165367543

 elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word 	 227.71289437604526

 well jane make haste and tell us 	 217.00929201809893

 oh yes 	 216.14931322517498

 i must find <title> gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed 	 586.8553900645941

 a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little 	 797.5366428517128

 what does he say 	 55.351220285452726

 la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before 	 1006.062077868517

 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used 	 256.6228313917254

 my visit was not long as caroline and <title> hurst were going out 	 630.4437498576206

 heaven and earth of what are you thinking 	 599.5687812055696

 your s & <initial> edw 	 49.935621488136775

 you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did 	 481.11043014205796

 his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it 	 408.34832979882617

 miss de bourgh was pale and sickly 	 409.3601053814238

 i am all astonishment 	 202.72577563614556

 elizabeth shook her head over this letter 	 414.67856423057555

 you may depend upon my not mentioning it 	 61.02653656972058

 they were of a respectable family in the north of england 	 177.45484019795077

 for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another 	 419.53159240909827

 as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister 	 201.2524785335597

 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever 	 486.45632266593316

 how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 	 150.98784901159647

 and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 	 152.72034528948106

 and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them 	 422.02588797791645

 the world has been deceived in that respect 	 383.3815935556717

 for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match 	 433.55822603493357

 i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes 	 47.47707998424356

 <initial> <number>  	 164.68512835779802

 all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 	 325.33251279350446

 chapter iv 	 2731.396376852312

 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight 	 697.281453559536

 i will go directly to <title> bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure 	 142.35158291270938

 with them he is remarkably agreeable 	 818.477779892939

 and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty 	 359.0980048436735

 he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed 	 336.548165387777

 i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life 	 180.02978550811173

 except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate 	 763.971205901495

 and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante 	 268.537416558973

 miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 	 244.27438913388252

 but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 	 198.70624182527166

 and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 	 279.6143949267744

 after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud 	 504.25344234560174

 in as short a time as <title> collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both 	 369.66794219536257

 it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 	 419.01938354496633

 i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford 	 498.77730162415384

 i grieve to find however that colonel <initial> is not disposed to depend upon their marriage 	 419.42788245924555

 you must feel it 	 42.55029811009249

 but depend upon it <title> collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason 	 162.40041396359402

 he studies too much for words of four syllables 	 570.5268908099301

 a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence 	 395.2973173000072

 but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much 	 208.68516915704174

 the housekeeper came 	 75.99675970352789

 if it is designedly done they cannot be justified 	 419.0458508144707

 you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it 	 87.98275440111374

 in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger 	 306.3460455637508

 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 	 483.9478967555095

 it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground 	 229.30946935179898

 her husband looked impenetrably grave 	 430.8356846015021

 they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which <title> bennet was beyond the reach of reason 	 91.17712202118742

 he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild 	 193.08139837588556

 his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own 	 186.29436722523306

 but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune 	 507.1052625428187

 and that is quite impossible 	 359.61331373004896

 are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted 	 655.6297279983816

 his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend 	 509.2968424143228

 are you quite sure ma am 	 117.77078107846584

 it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing 	 269.4284559383332

 will you come and see me 	 414.64237118822575

 yes sir 	 590.0893114867625

 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference 	 186.8971391812197

 they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either 	 458.2219564827544

 till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance 	 489.72428125243755

 the children have been wanting me this half hour 	 401.4618775713115

 but slyness seems the fashion 	 800.4025282383913

 oh jane take care 	 704.0236102090919

 she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked 	 305.11006075442646

 are not you curious to hear how it was managed 	 452.00659447814087

 i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind 	 431.33900913718384

 yes if darcy does not put it off again 	 426.23563183968264

 she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself 	 344.814305820186

 he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein 	 257.62615519781417

 <title> collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 	 147.2168963658617

 <title> bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation & <initial> <title> bennet was quite disconcerted 	 154.20392682493818

 you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered 	 151.21700932281854

 i can recal nothing worse 	 401.4678196341911

 it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn 	 106.96594096935954

 cried his wife impatiently 	 367.7599328989454

 yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week 	 274.28322318843794

 i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 	 294.94312391706075

 but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere 	 537.7769970898011

 but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity 	 324.24343202479133

 <title> hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker 	 814.6371493192383

 chapter xxi 	 2731.396376852312

 <title> bennet replied that he had not 	 59.269238707519115

 will you hear it 	 266.99954367265

 can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it 	 179.48619987612452

 but it will have no effect on me  	 389.2467805650231

 but before they heard again from <title> gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from <title> collins 	 512.5958453759898

 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe 	 319.1787427290864

 i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not 	 182.50201967518166

 have not you always hated him 	 852.4156921020073

 but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years 	 356.59939972479583

 she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility 	 206.49289761304766

 after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with <title> bingley how can <title> bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man 	 496.50819319900563

 then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce <title> bingley to her  	 205.68116049543184

 it is not quite a week since they left brighton 	 179.41211976640818

 but i believe we must abide by our original plan 	 360.31874888128334

 her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much 	 457.0246937176077

 we are not in a way to know what <title> bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit 	 180.14962471031907

 <title> gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it 	 147.8634841362856

 wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it 	 166.0378035363743

 the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice 	 573.5319579033959

 and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 	 115.58938578281992

 but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing 	 466.28400824538875

 you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form 	 596.505744458994

 elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother <initial> she could not determine how her mother would take it 	 415.58229136901195

 you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say 	 399.2648947534927

 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you 	 494.555337974973

 it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum 	 670.2990043265117

 any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <number>  	 165.40809748209313

 and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane 	 496.3242492649712

 they had long wished to see him 	 172.762267481406

 at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage 	 332.8672702041861

 i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it 	 286.91233282033596

 but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks 	 382.74838954769626

 he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else 	 210.51505829587154

 my dearest sister now be be serious 	 347.83920027845727

 and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her 	 316.145568470877

 the loo table however did not appear 	 250.8639265774156

 i mend pens remarkably well 	 691.735405063156

 it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year 	 265.9745718886967

 but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me 	 734.0800586167381

 but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters 	 294.57238725902414

 i know we dine with four and twenty families 	 597.1156896844054

 and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me 	 181.3392610686933

 the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father 	 368.78397438305143

 oh hang kitty what has she to do with it 	 778.1340724320625

 and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 	 249.60816902636307

 my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel 	 369.3544706250422

 but whatever may be the sentiments which <title> wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character 	 297.33121920703974

 but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 	 174.14408292125532

 i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married 	 278.37818907497945

 i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet <title> darcy 	 179.30982386617126

 oh <title> collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point 	 390.1623593614467

 what are you telling miss bennet 	 266.95003585020106

 they are certainly not gone to scotland 	 123.93609624757265

 but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it 	 296.8164706447721

 she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever 	 473.3641946014144

 they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds 	 335.43376406497435

 you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 	 270.5108830948909

 i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word 	 169.38363540933517

 but their progress was slow for <title> gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little 	 408.44111083089103

 his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect 	 690.0486313401555

 there could be no conversation in the noise of <title> philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body 	 241.61272283387012

 she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months 	 248.29706740102665

 the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment 	 333.83578326640065

 and you saw him frequently 	 239.3797735965593

 and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart 	 362.3382486669298

 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject <title> bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country 	 446.4732970845833

 they are wanted in the farm <title> bennet are not they 	 204.03567316686505

 she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him 	 288.0724316751188

 yes she will remain there till christmas 	 382.28601973049314

 miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour 	 93.82662523767301

 she could think of nothing more to say 	 39.957648865502236

 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make <title> darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister 	 384.6205591343953

 my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers 	 151.79004503080668

 he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north 	 518.1696552901234

 you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage 	 569.3006137002494

 but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain 	 242.84492440185093

 the business of her life was to get her daughters married 	 283.629742254227

 it will not do 	 48.13494916500831

 and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way 	 339.59628763133907

 sure he will not leave london before he has found them 	 575.5366375057099

 if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think 	 176.63337442911023

 i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel 	 401.0259437897509

 james <initial> the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 	 588.5271041996745

 we were married you know at st 	 621.8782766406326

 but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved 	 605.3960633557937

 in short i will do my best 	 423.7732146825952

 but what is that to me 	 176.45168669545478

 <title> collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give 	 456.6892528361492

 he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay 	 545.8581030561921

 he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do 	 435.94051212848746

 that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her 	 413.856316599223

 elizabeth felt herself completely taken in 	 327.1080418883865

 and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful 	 377.7032188968624

 some people call him proud 	 366.0963778889933

 and during part of that time <title> darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and <title> bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it 	 358.1403031868835

 do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will 	 475.10885600442225

 there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 	 274.6237012731106

 they were not the only objects of <title> collins s admiration 	 156.0018099314493

 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache 	 633.9080531599798

 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night 	 408.0568659728754

 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind 	 116.79678552938427

 but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report 	 349.2047107794801

 but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure 	 689.8179319371103

 her answer was warmly in his favour 	 416.33998281342133

 and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street 	 427.9779486940436

 i shall be back by dinner 	 204.36187973183235

 his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion 	 580.2040237471754

 and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion 	 218.13832866371567

 what a fine thing for our girls how so 	 627.4393839664796

 but <title> bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before 	 531.0416366034134

 found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence 	 1017.0951855437821

 perhaps i am not doing her justice 	 379.4415777356839

 chapter <initial> elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could 	 126.67524343566521

 he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before 	 436.0676918159469

 for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous 	 281.19272190335346

 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable 	 215.91585704460033

 the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary 	 654.2597739849582

 design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 	 224.73101628882387

 not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves 	 360.58876089137476

 and the others were to meet us at the church 	 321.6976801812684

 i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with 	 404.6580230223261

 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us 	 706.9921649557185

 i am glad he dines here on tuesday 	 194.33406092206903

 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on <title> darcy himself 	 174.6970026191682

 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from <title> bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters 	 351.71485967833786

 and so generous that you will always exceed your income 	 447.9552309076312

 for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction 	 355.97145150170013

 she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all 	 295.72381755672455

 elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly 	 504.2205401507122

 to this speech bingley made no answer 	 99.4551606160762

 every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months 	 500.812985584503

 if it be not so let <title> darcy contradict it 	 471.20728479460695

 to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <url> while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate 	 719.1685296932912

 they must all go to brighton 	 301.08702724079075

 your tempers are by no means unlike 	 430.8895507850915

 <title> hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep 	 234.9194883178096

 can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand 	 333.44319769524293

 and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness 	 171.07598509000337

 she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself 	 228.89187102576358

 no no let me shift for myself 	 624.7232472908166

 said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate 	 312.65799482089704

 when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers <title> wickham was sure to be one 	 397.8057495993778

 <initial> <number>  	 164.68512835779802

 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me 	 325.84068195535076

 and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you 	 276.29635390251786

 having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry 	 594.967922195764

 our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast 	 382.94454373756406

 if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what <title> gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own 	 597.4721126353711

 remember that she is one of a large family 	 402.43440048218537

 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children 	 79.78743222774206

 it had better have happened to you lizzy 	 166.16010650632305

 this account then is what he has received from <title> darcy 	 377.5937192146533

 and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards <title> wickham 	 412.822680080233

 and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it 	 240.48328398931375

 how is such a man to be worked on 	 78.21908450918846

 and she read it again 	 119.08783127753384

 the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised 	 528.7300773836891

 but the grounds are delightful 	 385.6482568026086

 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him 	 745.7195065063447

 her father lifted up his eyes 	 430.91647806139116

 but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself 	 517.76758987353

 i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes 	 261.9294097573816

 do let me ask my partner to introduce you 	 712.9751472432663

 to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you 	 450.7996169519609

 you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas 	 269.7380427295773

 write to me very often my dear 	 579.4970550025597

 it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 	 465.91152135163014

 they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses 	 742.3519642532526

 but when <title> philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room 	 402.39174705630626

 she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference 	 353.00459879076084

 money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir 	 401.2481035502793

 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield 	 413.19753718731624

 she repented though she hardly knew of what 	 438.97913118158283

 for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum 	 709.8013590687021

 elizabeth could not but look surprised 	 126.02695880347963

 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper 	 379.9933586511655

 my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better 	 421.01878181638756

 but now suppose as much as you chuse 	 150.91302896079372

 your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 	 457.05657849609594

 has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves 	 660.1983436171357

 she had gained her point and had time to consider of it 	 367.00445386930704

 he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable 	 536.1532946634247

 i am not now to learn replied <title> collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour 	 364.20717796960525

 that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well 	 290.83905562572585

 the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her 	 705.8351836295551

 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink 	 294.73351458148767

 and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world 	 258.53675568197684

 and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body 	 202.6301559229365

 it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 	 269.76760074341934

 he only told me what i have now told you 	 167.84038204215625

 what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex 	 447.2456932410097

 this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together 	 558.5416795117312

 there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say 	 132.43372848568785

 we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield 	 408.5535599606941

 and to him she had hardly courage to speak 	 208.34038984943

 her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable 	 383.0992546174774

 elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to <title> collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept <title> bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement 	 223.61750689336645

 their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart <title> darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing <title> and <title> gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country 	 225.98043740922918

 go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks 	 459.4108226770495

 you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged 	 272.5994563210613

 very true 	 101.58723402120728

 this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and <title> bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him 	 349.59186865906247

 you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you 	 147.34006412368805

 it was hardly enough 	 190.2606979673755

 it was an evening of no common delight to them all 	 210.0214197405476

 london printed for <initial> egerton military library whitehall 	 12.86878132986588

 and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly 	 239.48932693599042

 the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study 	 533.2802324927425

 the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it 	 599.6246951483355

 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone 	 437.3134989255912

 i do not see what right <title> darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy 	 325.36206902738655

 anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and <title> darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost 	 425.1990446162231

 kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters 	 352.58884565463416

 did he know of their intending to go off 	 669.3058275391268

 i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage 	 525.1659445943201

 but we are all liable to error 	 436.3232798067025

 but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate 	 546.1044197682844

 it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity 	 642.430901655227

 and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief 	 518.8652253714388

 and i should be miserable to forfeit it 	 175.2541241142205

 she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had <title> wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows 	 454.6117300743697

 i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 	 400.9894949969571

 give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey 	 385.09055948808026

 lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her 	 294.4113288326019

 and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain 	 202.29460920887038

 though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 	 494.87742475063675

 elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head 	 95.06204490274322

 darcy said nothing at all 	 309.8935288734354

 and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 	 202.7438772615069

 i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with 	 276.1863842812532

 all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return 	 218.88166227367

 as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them 	 355.81750484490817

 it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire 	 123.91687087630648

 at present i have not room to do them justice 	 278.86235765783636

 pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night 	 910.4348755247908

 it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea 	 369.74938144476226

 and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business 	 322.1975075654791

 what it contains has surprised me a good deal 	 635.2609509339907

 but with me it is not so 	 226.14687405644992

 these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature 	 342.1836133605087

 he came to tell <title> gardiner that he had found out where your sister and <title> wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once 	 291.4157717256016

 it became her turn to listen 	 772.4053943344267

 i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day 	 755.5050063042265

 you used us abominably ill answered <title> hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out 	 612.9568811161464

 and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining <title> bingley for his sister 	 207.88569444436277

 yes miss bennet interest 	 1506.7721736966673

 where else can they be so well concealed 	 1171.3397551625972

 and she sat down directly to the instrument 	 193.70937868589604

 in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 	 773.0573086147675

 his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased 	 336.73307612487474

 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before 	 114.28070738851989

 how can you talk so 	 178.78593334815503

 he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment 	 262.60802300036494

 on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks 	 422.8950956587111

 hope was over entirely over 	 1000.0

 you mistake me my dear 	 247.68567098033446

 i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man 	 309.78235352522574

 i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music 	 204.8643057395398

 for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support 	 601.529101660118

 your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come 	 600.2851893545894

 you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 	 142.13476722238988

 lydia declared herself satisfied 	 1190.7853569036265

 you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 	 188.08300224757974

 she was ashamed to think how much 	 311.98139377325873

 and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty 	 181.95902577943536

 if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence 	 447.60225093213523

 and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters 	 463.7466823483095

 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival 	 280.02039575329536

 but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done 	 107.55986553361035

 he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before 	 267.8069954460274

 and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 	 467.60421843664415

 and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites 	 380.6704807154457

 and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply 	 443.60438310628405

 our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day 	 1105.4713721338749

 nor did that day wear out her resentment 	 721.7338286532942

 he actually danced with her twice 	 221.35027972338256

 colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman 	 404.3414102356942

 with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart 	 513.8455177097882

 they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering 	 967.8956754560087

 but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to <title> darcy 	 167.0888944538807

 and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long <title> darcy had been staying there 	 493.1407267597335

 she was humbled she was grieved 	 334.83153800406467

 in this danger kitty is also comprehended 	 502.01993379214656

 elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham 	 474.9091225134377

 but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well 	 101.27318403402046

 if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least 	 551.9709565975414

 but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry 	 591.5435036899011

 lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion 	 689.5105501299219

 and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage 	 399.5816984095923

 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane 	 768.8243019207491

 and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring 	 224.18898958256733

 she was overpowered by shame and vexation 	 190.85583595520754

 but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger 	 237.1257181080837

 she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it 	 258.20392028201104

 that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer 	 530.5520226951265

 what a charming amusement for young people this is <title> darcy there is nothing like dancing after all 	 340.02676973330523

 and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared 	 407.9532768640596

 for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone 	 710.4294604873608

 <initial> <number>  	 164.68512835779802

 the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it 	 462.04155835458334

 and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications 	 175.4412038700953

 i have not an instant to lose 	 174.36329590457083

 and the kind of half expectation which <title> gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing 	 224.94537559972684

 to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with 	 453.85698803600366

 oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh my dear continued <title> bennet i am quite delighted with him 	 174.39751380624975

 lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 	 276.05545197593335

 when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door 	 680.2524307528432

 my dear <title> bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them 	 121.77481978579202

 hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 	 383.94917491980857
