 a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air 	4.869713751785289

 he held the bowl aloft and intoned — introibo ad altare dei  	2.8853684299302573

 halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely —come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest 	3.699167406596882

 he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains 	3.705379516228772

 then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head 	6.358364482407901

 stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak 	3.911332953880616

 buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly 	7.548055945714203

 he added in a preacher’s tone —for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns 	5.0388330538543

 slow music please 	35.26475749699104

 shut your eyes gents 	15.988835324586667

 one moment 	69.51151448969618

 a little trouble about those white corpuscles 	7.8255662651446745

 silence all 	106.90393588544737

 he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points 	2.9603277284744625

 two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm 	6.349819941727302

 —thanks old chap he cried briskly 	6.972310815878108

 that will do nicely 	16.683942426461694

 switch off the current will you 	13.781630969831985

 he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown 	5.092454312647098

 the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages 	3.6072989733977527

 a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips 	5.313391525305846

 —the mockery of it he said gaily 	9.893723751632015

 your absurd name an ancient greek he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself 	3.254640883583494

 stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck 	4.1189255705178125

 buck mulligan’s gay voice went on 	8.556237232194585

 —my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls 	4.923396650673044

 but it has a hellenic ring hasn’t it 	7.681804874227997

 tripping and sunny like the buck himself 	10.815560497617298

 we must go to athens 	25.154851800522405

 will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid 	5.1665566621512

 he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried —will he come 	4.519444296911039

 the jejune jesuit ceasing he began to shave with care 	4.493020153084344

 —tell me mulligan stephen said quietly 	9.837797420450656

 —yes my love 	16.747663701760068

 —how long is haines going to stay in this tower 	7.216642594708316

 buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder 	6.068333988551815

 —god isn’t he dreadful 	9.394073734126179

 he said frankly 	68.05694084556391

 a ponderous saxon 	34.779890885208886

 he thinks you’re not a gentleman 	9.855982827982263

 god these bloody english bursting with money and indigestion 	3.9428149540106547

 because he comes from oxford 	18.278665465901582

 you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner 	7.966728095452102

 he can’t make you out 	13.196343084014108

 o my name for you is the best kinch the knife blade 	11.285466963290464

 he shaved warily over his chin 	12.951311606619525

 —he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said 	6.428303733982731

 where is his guncase 	28.075168333053394

 —a woful lunatic mulligan said 	5.272361669938799

 were you in a funk 	37.40910870897298

 —i was stephen said with energy and growing fear 	7.640272385058981

 out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther 	5.720218471021201

 you saved men from drowning 	8.462720678268283

 i’m not a hero however 	7.108117531238266

 if he stays on here i am off 	9.353229475142292

 buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade 	14.308675086351746

 he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily 	4.136832564967727

 —scutter he cried thickly 	11.954938520682381

 he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket said —lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor 	4.196222928399309

 stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief 	5.197819992553231

 buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly 	5.872426569212002

 then gazing over the handkerchief he said —the bard’s noserag a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen 	6.50968227685021

 you can almost taste it can’t you 	5.759314386530954

 he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly 	3.9828796732351472

 —god he said quietly 	20.167290554595525

 isn’t the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother 	6.445209472012603

 the snotgreen sea 	29.034903414560628

 the scrotumtightening sea 	29.034903414560628

 epi oinopa ponton  	35.26475749699104

 ah dedalus the greeks i must teach you 	6.833984505271142

 you must read them in the original 	14.08152530462377

 thalatta thalatta she is our great sweet mother 	7.273726699201564

 come and look 	36.210282455149894

 stephen stood up and went over to the parapet 	9.90240664773136

 leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown 	8.860220329097288

 —our mighty mother buck mulligan said 	5.444811386435492

 he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face 	6.030680274604485

 that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you 	6.118794208939993

 —someone killed her stephen said gloomily 	9.086311103738433

 —you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said 	3.134840111195312

 i’m hyperborean as much as you 	5.662529444593888

 but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her 	5.724816622017892

 and you refused 	44.359220990358104

 there is something sinister in you 	7.392911062191969

 he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek 	3.8742088561014123

 a tolerant smile curled his lips 	5.254028710357403

 —but a lovely mummer he murmured to himself 	6.105815719876777

 kinch the loveliest mummer of them all he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously 	5.787096265865459

 stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve 	4.744515953315392

 pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart 	6.989144280980016

 silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes 	2.970176933992041

 across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him 	4.971194613715496

 the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid 	3.6030642865452154

 a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting 	3.1020939231195466

 buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade 	7.679140181564551

 —ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice 	10.17584396393004

 i must give you a shirt and a few noserags 	13.301999946072065

 how are the secondhand breeks 	14.365378600237833

 —they fit well enough stephen answered 	4.237282272978698

 buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip 	5.5514597732251625

 —the mockery of it he said contentedly 	9.893723751632015

 secondleg they should be 	19.045219833323447

 god knows what poxy bowsy left them off 	4.609513916371372

 i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey 	8.005864007515612

 you’ll look spiffing in them 	6.431893821565768

 i’m not joking kinch 	5.424178176515866

 you look damn well when you’re dressed 	9.600902580464327

 —thanks stephen said 	12.034484002176146

 i can’t wear them if they are grey 	8.380012855441693

 —he can’t wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror 	7.134229767885955

 etiquette is etiquette 	35.26475749699104

 he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers 	8.71551064373531

 he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin 	3.340212264600475

 —that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have <initial> <initial> <initial> he’s up in dottyville with connolly norman 	7.522955608142048

 general paralysis of the insane he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea 	3.8898056458230332

 his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth 	7.328594118499055

 laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk 	7.011532959255474

 —look at yourself he said you dreadful bard stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack 	5.617751206414338

 as he and others see me 	19.2399665353989

 who chose this face for me 	6.6105618933362305

 this dogsbody to rid of vermin 	7.097452217511127

 it asks me too 	13.629489470996422

 —i pinched it out of the skivvy’s room buck mulligan said 	8.008720285797732

 it does her all right 	11.203243456041843

 the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi 	3.4270549351076163

 lead him not into temptation 	14.764832944994081

 and her name is ursula 	24.133344652752353

 laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes 	10.103073226640571

 if wilde were only alive to see you drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness —it is a symbol of irish art 	4.417607625472488

 the cracked lookingglass of a servant 	11.272862007791973

 buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them 	5.788775577457063

 —it’s not fair to tease you like that kinch is it 	5.911335414192545

 he said kindly 	47.545436858005665

 god knows you have more spirit than any of them 	7.184051682704119

 parried again 	209.41671971432194

 he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his 	5.674226839740831

 the cold steel pen 	13.832757448949687

 —cracked lookingglass of a servant tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea 	5.107539928857106

 he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman 	5.116579537350006

 his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other 	2.9879066063328428

 god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island 	7.972474938164943

 hellenise it 	209.41671971432194

 cranly’s arm 	50.06033053186022

 his arm 	152.52239858468985

 —and to think of your having to beg from these swine 	6.464966630581736

 i’m the only one that knows what you are 	8.455822088203568

 why don’t you trust me more 	7.7102295751034875

 what have you up your nose against me 	6.704673676230751

 is it haines 	45.98496272891489

 if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe 	4.238088636234314

 young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe’s roo <title> palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another 	2.6726636165581126

 o i shall expire break the news to her gently aubrey i shall die with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor’s shears 	3.721827120242213

 a scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade 	6.769248363534093

 i don’t want to be debagged don’t you play the giddy ox with me shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle 	4.697688832720275

 a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnold’s face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshal <title> to ourselves 	2.5705338166834886

 new paganism 	144.31163439856488

 —let him stay stephen said 	7.545730751638847

 there’s nothing wrong with him except at night 	6.276940739870725

 —then what is it 	9.722010372752669

 buck mulligan asked impatiently 	14.230704229383903

 i’m quite frank with you 	4.759004955200022

 what have you against me now 	9.378750553561067

 they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale 	5.514486026621924

 stephen freed his arm quietly 	12.421757425655306

 —do you wish me to tell you 	11.347575292319439

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 —yes what is it 	9.227035018846928

 buck mulligan answered 	20.036661282800548

 i don’t remember anything 	7.4160515388047505

 he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke 	10.190637439685917

 a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes 	3.0352055769965762

 stephen depressed by his own voice said —do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death 	6.781714446381448

 buck mulligan frowned quickly and said —what 	6.567657488298994

 i can’t remember anything 	9.74189098834654

 i remember only ideas and sensations 	5.8588199989357665

 what happened in the name of god 	16.300508887470347

 —you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water 	6.6107647069732165

 your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom 	13.244779222864526

 she asked you who was in your room 	16.381393847542697

 what did i say 	16.04151436775133

 i forget 	188.44898604147352

 —you said stephen answered o it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead 	4.343450673593212

 a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek 	4.926735874133443

 —did i say that 	12.8198687979071

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 what harm is that 	13.425414200852813

 he shook his constraint from him nervously 	8.947439647371892

 —and what is death he asked your mother’s or yours or my own 	5.8656645399610685

 you saw only your mother die 	12.523662426356235

 i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom 	5.046441462351816

 it’s a beastly thing and nothing else 	5.909395000151043

 it simply doesn’t matter 	23.385259069493504

 you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you 	7.952132315338991

 because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only it’s injected the wrong way 	6.404163896113714

 to me it’s all a mockery and beastly 	8.404461415712863

 her cerebral lobes are not functioning 	8.873423509689529

 humour her till it’s over 	15.33357830084801

 you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don’t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette’ <initial> absurd i suppose i did say it 	3.875080573648568

 i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother 	5.018886019763683

 he had spoken himself into boldness 	9.779766736772805

 stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly —i am not thinking of the offence to my mother 	5.730458170027362

 —of what then 	28.953336998656578

 —of the offence to me stephen answered 	13.549382660671748

 buck mulligan swung round on his heel 	11.24112599476418

 —o an impossible person he exclaimed 	4.6268282093811415

 he walked off quickly round the parapet 	8.745829884063374

 stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland 	6.683606582790224

 sea and headland now grew dim 	8.651167141826003

 pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks 	7.241340789645883

 a voice within the tower called loudly —are you up there mulligan 	5.4159039070269035

 —i’m coming buck mulligan answered 	5.798833658253802

 he turned towards stephen and said —look at the sea 	9.201839042367029

 what does it care about offences 	9.736914686221978

 chuck loyola kinch and come on down 	11.476736501790691

 the sassenach wants his morning rashers 	6.048279589574996

 his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof —don’t mope over it all day he said 	7.108109960949618

 i’m inconsequent 	15.3339228817215

 give up the moody brooding 	18.991163489506313

 his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars 	3.71314749443482

 inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet 	4.585826604552873

 white breast of the dim sea 	20.808935367842714

 the twining stresses two by two 	5.3884045333067405

 a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords 	3.6690063487668576

 wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide 	9.767688410070427

 a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green 	3.2773250200053585

 fergus’ song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords 	5.71451631353405

 her door was open she wanted to hear my music 	6.780737785446611

 silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside 	9.751442032164583

 she was crying in her wretched bed 	11.547770170724654

 for those words stephen love’s bitter mystery 	9.844273423919947

 where now 	182.27624413042315

 her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer 	2.265171895950655

 a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl 	8.142634047082101

 she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility 	3.67281935446864

 phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed 	9.74115693607997

 and no more turn aside and brood 	6.980293354742769

 folded away in the memory of nature with her toys 	15.410071767158776

 memories beset his brooding brain 	8.480169657860364

 her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament 	8.74004637251517

 a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening 	5.567734384825007

 her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts 	9.767970519591112

 in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes 	2.6985961778284424

 her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul 	4.9220337082115835

 on me alone 	94.24009729323353

 the ghostcandle to light her agony 	7.598884909713882

 ghostly light on the tortured face 	19.647942077433758

 her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees 	2.9781892471848894

 her eyes on me to strike me down 	16.947446772299028

 liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat 	2.2767982727436857

 ghoul chewer of corpses no mother let me be and let me live 	5.25672026691751

 —kinch ahoy buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower 	6.096005917603341

 it came nearer up the staircase calling again 	9.587641469123696

 stephen still trembling at his soul’s cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words 	5.396504590854688

 —dedalus come down like a good mosey 	12.417830892564858

 breakfast is ready 	35.26475749699104

 haines is apologising for waking us last night 	3.8358844961559724

 it’s all right 	7.358709475146859

 —i’m coming stephen said turning 	6.94924197421267

 —do for jesus’ sake buck mulligan said 	4.906932278846082

 for my sake and for all our sakes 	9.520369769875384

 his head disappeared and reappeared 	10.89019767515768

 —i told him your symbol of irish art 	6.3712956184252265

 he says it’s very clever 	14.615027920152484

 touch him for a quid will you 	11.77730177034942

 a guinea i mean 	17.031529859854246

 —i get paid this morning stephen said 	7.243199732418796

 —if you want it stephen said 	9.056062621229055

 —four shining sovereigns buck mulligan cried with delight 	4.826197660908195

 we’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids 	4.149854345135277

 four omnipotent sovereigns 	27.171103538051497

 he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent o won’t we have a merry time drinking whisky beer and wine on coronation coronation day o won’t we have a merry time on coronation day warm sunshine merrying over the sea 	3.183464603955052

 the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet 	7.279373630106619

 why should i bring it down 	8.731405624065415

 or leave it there all day forgotten friendship 	10.266312035373499

 he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck 	5.162945217939477

 so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes 	5.699270523528585

 i am another now and yet the same 	7.888051018358156

 a servant too 	43.819916639321505

 a server of a servant 	15.507583094521651

 in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow 	4.541755397784275

 haines open that door will you 	6.004645350591283

 stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker 	12.88377403924214

 a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors 	6.267588076729491

 —have you the key 	11.475132765546274

 a voice asked 	20.618665682433534

 janey mack i’m choked he howled without looking up from the fire —kinch —it’s in the lock stephen said coming forward 	5.162753933540888

 the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered 	3.5111763162386853

 stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait 	5.358913158557737

 buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him 	7.190244061248488

 then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief 	4.286005020889396

 —i’m melting he said as the candle remarked when 	7.460459627413193

 but hush not a word more on that subject kinch wake up bread butter honey 	4.033952147385694

 haines come in 	28.61748026940735

 where’s the sugar 	18.20625357054608

 o jay there’s no milk 	12.853113032643655

 stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker 	9.603911228730123

 buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet 	15.89151780173465

 —what sort of a kip is this 	9.76526063630127

 i told her to come after eight 	11.033533220664527

 —we can drink it black stephen said thirstily 	6.12027425745279

 there’s a lemon in the locker 	14.499940536260684

 —o damn you and your paris fads buck mulligan said 	4.545322817242475

 i want sandycove milk 	16.072844118477178

 haines came in from the doorway and said quietly —that woman is coming up with the milk 	10.046923193586403

 —the blessings of god on you buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair 	6.198693195665692

 sit down 	97.8154923973987

 pour out the tea there 	21.21794422813997

 the sugar is in the bag 	19.71895280677154

 here i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs 	7.774709622154576

 he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying — in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti 	4.3134302765251835

 haines sat down to pour out the tea 	8.977451241617997

 —i’m giving you two lumps each he said 	3.5117714751850735

 buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old woman’s wheedling voice —when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said 	5.794947483376362

 and when i makes water i makes water 	5.937557673560858

 —by jove it is tea haines said 	6.8002893349899445

 buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling — so i do mrs cahill says she 	4.489509844997349

 begob ma’am says mrs cahill god send you don’t make them in the one pot 	5.493017398204939

 he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife 	4.366012857975521

 —that’s folk he said very earnestly for your book haines 	5.714476326367821

 five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum 	4.694852399871511

 printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind 	15.763021805075299

 he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows —can you recall brother is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads 	4.813743042745434

 —i doubt it said stephen gravely 	7.593545105194199

 —do you now 	21.182002222986224

 buck mulligan said in the same tone 	13.82185412902105

 your reasons pray 	28.49141612524242

 —i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion 	6.8588211996447885

 mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann 	5.102044120751559

 —charming he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly 	4.881565288615338

 do you think she was 	11.41496895691541

 quite charming then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf —for old mary ann she doesn’t care a damn 	3.8337242792671864

 but hising up her petticoats 	14.410815088665107

 he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned 	4.429407877929922

 the doorway was darkened by an entering form 	7.6424227010540156

 —the milk sir —come in ma’am mulligan said 	4.1846937208215955

 kinch get the jug 	26.353671953269437

 an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow 	9.690027929873946

 —that’s a lovely morning sir she said 	5.682347943873897

 glory be to god 	11.86503376699172

 —to whom 	29.576816255038988

 mulligan said glancing at her 	17.130074221136823

 ah to be sure stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker 	8.44603554059056

 —the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces 	4.399915857378259

 —how much sir 	15.863390724322652

 asked the old woman 	32.099815983716695

 —a quart stephen said 	10.496850087399686

 he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers 	3.831734830201576

 old shrunken paps 	27.12474462003013

 she poured again a measureful and a tilly 	7.9988615796954425

 old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger 	5.387322288552601

 she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out 	7.399918602267686

 crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs 	4.21194468677772

 they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle 	5.977754853247122

 silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times 	8.152654885146573

 a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning 	3.4323749478026744

 to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour 	3.8599642289535256

 —it is indeed ma’am buck mulligan said pouring milk into their cups 	3.6588705826084453

 —taste it sir she said 	7.474832237216245

 he drank at her bidding 	13.984570327204203

 —if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts 	5.154336313813366

 living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives’ spits 	4.087143491496274

 —are you a medical student sir 	6.964360349451261

 the old woman asked 	23.316751282159622

 —i am ma’am buck mulligan answered 	5.79756750163722

 —look at that now she said 	10.661710869545168

 stephen listened in scornful silence 	8.551654660536602

 she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights 	4.245670380660306

 to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness the serpent’s prey 	8.011666905824558

 and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes 	4.595483913955679

 —do you understand what he says 	10.503263590261536

 stephen asked her 	16.68959489922537

 —is it french you are talking sir 	7.165732337244346

 the old woman said to haines 	10.488662610058075

 haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently 	8.16370967192661

 —irish buck mulligan said 	10.173793588239255

 is there gaelic on you 	11.35794545209443

 —i thought it was irish she said by the sound of it 	8.84691942638928

 are you from the west sir 	25.514359956246018

 —i am an englishman haines answered 	6.630291033499882

 —he’s english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland 	6.791004926162041

 —sure we ought to the old woman said and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself 	7.450252352713691

 i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows 	4.893585512472382

 —grand is no name for it said buck mulligan 	7.276671604018644

 wonderful entirely 	146.3051524102258

 fill us out some more tea kinch 	6.976560093917838

 would you like a cup ma’am 	8.482930952031998

 —no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go 	4.787999314772506

 haines said to her —have you your bill 	13.50657382211997

 we had better pay her mulligan hadn’t we 	4.826341482520344

 stephen filled again the three cups 	12.748807159968464

 —bill sir 	32.67479702455199

 she said halting 	38.6339811745163

 well it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling 	2.9689229714653647

 that’s a shilling and one and two is two and two sir 	7.1466445091849025

 buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets 	3.359295762636569

 —pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling 	8.586701417596428

 stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk 	2.986316233131804

 buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried —a miracle he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying —ask nothing more of me sweet 	6.029808142977715

 all i can give you i give 	14.494647800492062

 stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand 	7.926320072892967

 —we’ll owe twopence he said 	6.020268169732116

 —time enough sir she said taking the coin 	7.001518077262785

 time enough 	56.31448552453714

 good morning sir 	20.623773135947463

 she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant —heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet 	5.608127632935886

 he turned to stephen and said —seriously dedalus 	4.656275435312918

 i’m stony 	15.3339228817215

 hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money 	4.73181889411874

 today the bards must drink and junket 	6.056918193836612

 ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty 	5.494560960264044

 —that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today 	5.0818527947608905

 —our swim first buck mulligan said 	4.931494520148196

 he turned to stephen and asked blandly —is this the day for your monthly wash kinch 	4.937959620777089

 then he said to haines —the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month 	4.892160264960437

 —all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf 	6.465666477234041

 haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke —i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me 	6.405051927775333

 speaking to me 	36.91389597004865

 they wash and tub and scrub 	6.8301243763721775

 yet here’s a spot 	18.62262069328671

 —that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good 	4.365910324854079

 buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone —wait till you hear him on hamlet haines 	5.730704083902008

 —well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen 	7.058712803329602

 i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in 	6.807238286702105

 —would i make any money by it 	6.104002312143379

 stephen asked 	34.09091809903735

 haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said —i don’t know i’m sure 	6.836542053107798

 buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour —you put your hoof in it now 	4.527001778089989

 what did you say that for 	14.397372114946235

 stephen said 	55.30511046438131

 the problem is to get money 	34.09909330295596

 from whom 	164.30180425256088

 from the milkwoman or from him 	9.207782988213351

 it’s a toss up i think 	6.6675009028013195

 —i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes 	4.476681945391715

 —i see little hope stephen said from her or from him 	6.295648464425542

 buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm 	6.729233532717578

 —from me kinch he said 	8.11446451485981

 in a suddenly changed tone he added —to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right 	6.819470322878265

 damn all else they are good for 	9.771945048124168

 why don’t you play them as i do 	7.165134728020709

 to hell with them all 	11.836287555283802

 let us get out of the kip 	17.909950918254776

 he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly —mulligan is stripped of his garments 	3.157264269771901

 he emptied his pockets on to the table 	7.457075104140535

 —there’s your snotrag he said 	6.1246950286784525

 and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain 	6.308271206646283

 his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief 	6.680850661252738

 god we’ll simply have to dress the character 	8.418972588237637

 i want puce gloves and green boots 	6.639658491307672

 do i contradict myself 	23.834793449833075

 very well then i contradict myself 	11.356460938896877

 mercurial malachi 	122.28297054636944

 a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands 	6.983925856668907

 stephen picked it up and put it on 	12.327121419007398

 haines called to them from the doorway —are you coming you fellows 	8.864318339478976

 —i’m ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door 	3.9548025983415203

 come out kinch 	41.627839223826655

 you have eaten all we left i suppose 	5.2589052255048125

 resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow —and going forth he met butterly 	3.977177051442722

 stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it 	5.094930555106135

 he put the huge key in his inner pocket 	10.659399313990512

 at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked —did you bring the key 	8.28849822590501

 —i have it stephen said preceding them 	8.402078776753562

 he walked on 	13.07570378169558

 —down sir how dare you sir haines asked —do you pay rent for this tower 	4.148093880630739

 —twelve quid buck mulligan said 	6.911448906498788

 —to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder 	4.607687479467869

 they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last —rather bleak in wintertime i should say 	3.0556252140254014

 martello you call it 	17.877888764650734

 —billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea 	5.012356043643711

 but ours is the omphalos  	20.836358461258182

 —what is your idea of hamlet 	7.106659002754142

 haines asked stephen 	23.906771866588507

 —no no buck mulligan shouted in pain 	8.60069701548093

 i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up 	4.554420418384681

 wait till i have a few pints in me first 	9.809338760164659

 he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat —you couldn’t manage it under three pints kinch could you 	3.969938586623358

 —it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer 	5.454839818779109

 —you pique my curiosity haines said amiably 	4.976716157343647

 —pooh buck mulligan said 	10.173793588239255

 we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes 	10.860283762591367

 it’s quite simple 	13.648822924364381

 he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father 	6.188981940080047

 haines said beginning to point at stephen 	8.891511759777131

 he himself 	101.60604936281831

 buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephen’s ear —o shade of kinch the elder japhet in search of a father —we’re always tired in the morning stephen said to haines 	4.212009114753516

 and it is rather long to tell 	11.887580463611917

 buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands 	6.606152666825746

 —the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said 	2.910895483709984

 —i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore 	4.460040928226641

 that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it 	6.75478460163701

 buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak 	5.347909771866979

 in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires 	3.988554127556592

 —it’s a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again 	4.713787783580751

 eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent 	5.264976142158036

 the seas’ ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins 	6.112621894721062

 —i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused 	7.4295795926305335

 the father and the son idea 	33.21241831418637

 the son striving to be atoned with the father 	11.605566267824578

 buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face 	7.244727013969159

 he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety 	2.9568535079597407

 he moved a doll’s head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice —i’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard 	3.932450243951881

 with joseph the joiner i cannot agree 	5.906384639813503

 so here’s to disciples and calvary 	9.327752733678427

 he held up a forefinger of warning 	8.428673654594574

 he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted —goodbye now goodbye write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead 	3.951905862425189

 what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet’s breezy 	7.385851610940205

 goodbye now goodbye he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries 	2.9917020357411537

 haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said —we oughtn’t to laugh i suppose 	5.600956773087382

 he’s rather blasphemous 	13.804177968231786

 i’m not a believer myself that is to say 	3.952065517673595

 still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesn’t it 	5.658088103656066

 what did he call it 	10.244123764097122

 —the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered 	3.789332506706598

 —o haines said you have heard it before 	8.21266491293409

 —three times a day after meals stephen said drily 	8.135108529122242

 —you’re not a believer are you 	5.228927343809082

 haines asked 	67.48710188394993

 i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word 	11.09540469887389

 creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god 	6.470581729938649

 —there’s only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said 	7.148420433314837

 haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone 	5.189483611940793

 he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it 	6.855978006653922

 —thank you stephen said taking a cigarette 	10.89736840994027

 haines helped himself and snapped the case to 	8.47064626171067

 he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands 	4.337085548189438

 —yes of course he said as they went on again 	12.301052652382579

 either you believe or you don’t isn’t it 	7.132863135365478

 personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal god 	9.06710116053946

 you don’t stand for that i suppose 	13.034376272819436

 —you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought 	3.5828538767605362

 he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side 	5.776762355759441

 its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels 	7.60073644051818

 my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen a wavering line along the path 	3.666228172235337

 they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark 	6.141847465161686

 he wants that key 	16.40025327205905

 it is mine 	39.39329460678412

 i paid the rent 	19.306334360801326

 now i eat his salt bread 	5.6289684807951375

 give him the key too 	17.86725149553381

 he will ask for it 	10.981699565964227

 that was in his eyes 	17.007100988372777

 stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind 	7.96434592832167

 —after all i should think you are able to free yourself 	8.797992660345052

 you are your own master it seems to me 	6.536192818983373

 —i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian 	5.005444863114557

 haines said 	55.98890368360917

 a crazy queen old and jealous 	6.8704857369060734

 —and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs 	8.452366864487896

 haines said again 	36.039791388681714

 —the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church 	3.849186902151382

 haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke 	5.205601916637213

 —i can quite understand that he said calmly 	9.683256538910022

 an irishman must think like that i daresay 	8.25935062970811

 we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly 	3.995542849828265

 it seems history is to blame 	9.698544647667159

 the proud potent titles clanged over stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars 	2.240676856191933

 symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs 	3.3685925596932926

 a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christ’s terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son 	3.950449763967573

 words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger 	6.0268888410171275

 idle mockery 	209.41671971432194

 the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michael’s host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields 	3.921793031183469

 zut nom de dieu —of course i’m a britisher haines’s voice said and i feel as one 	6.966603867914519

 i don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either 	5.260113121975088

 that’s our national problem i’m afraid just now 	5.514818416640946

 two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman 	8.967667686865376

 —she’s making for bullock harbour 	9.805371176832711

 the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain 	13.471385694509928

 —there’s five fathoms out there he said 	8.402214718865851

 it’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one 	6.11902051332516

 it’s nine days today 	11.949510609367582

 the man that was drowned 	15.004135862601462

 a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite 	4.256952278157568

 here i am 	17.358039742752876

 buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder 	3.5805563322246643

 a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water 	5.017637522852456

 —is the brother with you malachi 	15.95751315572224

 —down in westmeath 	28.964495654123102

 with the bannons 	145.32701253235342

 —still there 	26.525860373362008

 i got a card from bannon 	19.21107967309232

 says he found a sweet young thing down there 	6.3624249158956285

 photo girl he calls her 	14.108785543905054

 —snapshot eh 	32.67479702455199

 brief exposure 	209.41671971432194

 buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots 	6.2087488955178465

 an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face 	3.572782939846569

 he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth 	3.9356612657265475

 buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone 	3.4205261294292195

 —seymour’s back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock 	4.650322252689237

 —ah go to god buck mulligan said 	8.755326538955758

 —going over next week to stew 	5.755894821307254

 you know that red carlisle girl lily 	4.8206636715778375

 —spooning with him last night on the pier 	13.397354473230623

 the father is rotto with money 	9.325945763461192

 —is she up the pole 	18.338451280424405

 —better ask seymour that 	7.503702190097203

 —seymour a bleeding officer buck mulligan said 	4.661593393300469

 he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely —redheaded women buck like goats 	5.005295113548414

 he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt 	5.6285671429952195

 —my twelfth rib is gone he cried 	4.523786903347116

 i’m the übermensch 	7.653121653469289

 toothless kinch and i the supermen 	13.987398733228915

 he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay 	7.184978798056598

 —are you going in here malachi 	6.819901597151245

 make room in the bed 	29.16845246144427

 the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes 	4.722227182208502

 haines sat down on a stone smoking 	13.484895868107374

 —are you not coming in 	7.429064873413022

 —later on haines said 	10.689065475211468

 not on my breakfast 	27.551078982815785

 stephen turned away 	23.04253061506365

 —i’m going mulligan he said 	4.352141851887433

 —give us that key kinch buck mulligan said to keep my chemise flat 	4.9889064003329375

 stephen handed him the key 	14.567888586743905

 buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes 	5.5514597732251625

 throw it there 	58.58815137292492

 stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap 	10.207431200967177

 dressing undressing 	172.9342353939454

 buck mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly —he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord 	4.997269583684567

 thus spake zarathustra 	28.6284267584821

 his plump body plunged 	12.349995894116317

 —we’ll see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish 	3.7355014411963707

 horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a saxon 	15.404226206174451

 —the ship buck mulligan cried 	11.422547226071432

 half twelve 	153.2511041101208

 —good stephen said 	13.16134583153251

 he walked along the upwardcurving path 	9.485409096499545

 liliata rutilantium 	92.3177142496671

 turma circumdet 	122.28297054636944

 iubilantium te virginum 	20.426315171871458

 the priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly 	7.2087864970502045

 i will not sleep here tonight 	6.4863876611937625

 home also i cannot go 	10.837931258473773

 a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea 	7.284274161794796

 turning the curve he waved his hand 	5.396794822922078

 it called again 	32.556630556581

 <number> —you cochrane what city sent for him 	7.474300101729592

 —tarentum sir 	32.67479702455199

 —very good 	20.620349853217856

 —there was a battle sir 	10.36680385526757

 —very good 	20.620349853217856

 the boy’s blank face asked the blank window 	7.712020905706727

 and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it 	6.9622055947792605

 a phrase then of impatience thud of blake’s wings of excess 	5.089717149892497

 i hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame 	2.4892497319910087

 what’s left us then 	12.572161096599174

 —i forget the place sir 	16.619106753805525

 <number> <initial> <initial> —asculum stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book 	11.141895665078074

 —yes sir 	8.905811526627181

 and he said another victory like that and we are done for 	10.310120482964772

 that phrase the world had remembered 	12.149647874969958

 a dull ease of the mind 	20.038840605347627

 from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear 	3.9013329385718722

 any general to any officers 	11.028545488616867

 they lend ear 	29.38803583308196

 —you armstrong stephen said 	7.590668395685766

 what was the end of pyrrhus 	15.118744385438339

 —end of pyrrhus sir 	13.906230251104851

 —i know sir 	16.763436795549442

 ask me sir comyn said 	8.249908571644152

 do you know anything about pyrrhus 	9.150631076136607

 a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong’s satchel 	6.298896475434782

 he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly 	3.6127439584369765

 crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips 	18.349444436078464

 a sweetened boy’s breath 	17.574795052180182

 welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy 	6.893328767205092

 vico road dalkey 	35.26475749699104

 —pyrrhus sir 	32.67479702455199

 pyrrhus a pier 	31.039924200854312

 all laughed 	157.04395939975703

 mirthless high malicious laughter 	14.471237670438626

 armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile 	5.26146999174098

 —tell me now stephen said poking the boy’s shoulder with the book what is a pier 	9.876637448889781

 —a pier sir armstrong said 	5.272361669938799

 a thing out in the water 	32.04088465766659

 a kind of a bridge 	28.88684921198779

 some laughed again mirthless but with meaning 	6.520748066838456

 two in the back bench whispered 	23.98168983474273

 they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent 	5.5514673563853725

 with envy he watched their faces edith ethel gerty lily 	4.050984559518183

 —kingstown pier stephen said 	8.100796810646182

 yes a disappointed bridge 	13.765879063407173

 the words troubled their gaze 	10.440738675086983

 —how sir 	28.643857797169158

 comyn asked 	209.41671971432194

 a bridge is across a river 	6.309757241823921

 for haines’s chapbook 	40.30614543421576

 no one here to hear 	10.547714918314167

 tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind 	4.544216174350418

 what then 	167.8609944293509

 a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement master’s praise 	6.217964012598085

 why had they chosen all that part 	7.177599580429834

 not wholly for the smooth caress 	18.899790113039785

 had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death 	4.030352176006514

 they are not to be thought away 	12.891084032440283

 time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted 	8.485081055939686

 but can those have been possible seeing that they never were 	6.794167663840703

 or was that only possible which came to pass 	7.962056619625277

 weave weaver of the wind 	39.72893019159816

 —tell us a story sir 	12.4115208923481

 —o do sir 	14.596405027528835

 a ghoststory 	145.03650468355337

 —where do you begin in this 	9.121055206337306

 stephen asked opening another book 	5.4133670754095355

 — weep no more comyn said 	10.65829299418568

 —go on then talbot 	10.69632014261219

 —and the story sir 	19.263855820081755

 —after stephen said 	12.5943106382156

 go on talbot 	48.35501016187419

 a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel 	4.873849374841683

 he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text —weep no more woful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 	2.775064261563021

 it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible 	6.352373368942292

 aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night 	4.915658103403495

 by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy 	4.200571776871146

 fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds 	3.301409742154253

 thought is the thought of thought 	29.876661762915116

 —turn over stephen said quietly 	15.18355477682326

 i don’t see anything 	8.523721430030834

 talbot asked simply bending forward 	7.855112172478605

 his hand turned the page over 	12.38066517295841

 he leaned back and went on again having just remembered 	5.729730939367484

 of him that walked the waves 	12.574321321059854

 here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine 	4.733436189215937

 it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute 	6.058583770583904

 talbot slid his closed book into his satchel 	6.2928514460377665

 —have i heard all 	20.423666505172456

 stephen asked 	34.09091809903735

 —yes sir 	8.905811526627181

 hockey at ten sir 	17.209298800581017

 —half day sir 	12.034484002176146

 —who can answer a riddle 	6.458208505323002

 stephen asked 	34.09091809903735

 they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling 	3.085959249890426

 crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily —a riddle sir 	2.8738107506565016

 ask me sir 	23.35472768050352

 —o ask me sir 	8.148673454589973

 —a hard one sir 	10.143789626302313

 —this is the riddle stephen said the cock crew the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven 	3.5439082950430794

 ’tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven 	6.895946103626413

 what is that 	17.41753472289933

 —again sir 	32.67479702455199

 we didn’t hear 	18.161736178903503

 their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated 	6.856623112027655

 after a silence cochrane said —what is it sir 	7.007362552642079

 we give it up 	22.011911776525725

 stephen his throat itching answered —the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush 	5.0023997896675505

 he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay 	3.5452224714610456

 a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called —hockey they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them 	5.792547781079335

 quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues 	5.066788851540142

 sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook 	3.7171223488915697

 his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading 	2.8396358268190123

 on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snail’s bed 	3.908856028759005

 he held out his copybook 	16.869620555113173

 the word sums was written on the headline 	11.940654910099353

 beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot 	4.067202271732455

 cyril sargent his name and seal 	14.633276313564245

 —mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir 	9.606416683816946

 stephen touched the edges of the book 	12.922522404034787

 —do you understand how to do them now 	8.507928871359377

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 —numbers eleven to fifteen sargent answered 	4.919859156230703

 mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir 	9.511762174446238

 —can you do them yourself 	12.36039249855524

 stephen asked 	34.09091809903735

 —no sir 	27.760656001545534

 ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snail’s bed 	4.888774187217815

 yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart 	7.738035290336463

 but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail 	6.978280078856576

 she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own 	3.9167020551753473

 was that then real 	29.006130600608525

 the only true thing in life 	9.478660079318683

 his mother’s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode 	4.938170782973573

 she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes 	5.692171074307365

 she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been 	4.148913895168124

 a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped 	3.5724810677210797

 sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem 	7.609695572008237

 he proves by algebra that shakespeare’s ghost is hamlet’s grandfather 	6.9025921581672

 hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field 	10.417264916894533

 across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes 	3.466720718064894

 give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors 	5.312591820493643

 gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend 	3.4253749082242853

 —do you understand now 	10.93692116991498

 can you work the second for yourself 	9.108731521746813

 —yes sir 	8.905811526627181

 in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data 	3.4307472559809007

 waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin 	3.9519249232361844

 amor matris subjective and objective genitive 	4.7460382239607215

 with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands 	4.635352092613967

 like him was i these sloping shoulders this gracelessness 	6.07077057320981

 my childhood bends beside me 	7.265320243704539

 too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly 	8.598451816598878

 mine is far and his secret as our eyes 	7.617128058212964

 secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned 	4.1871999042454275

 the sum was done 	18.64081512975072

 —it is very simple stephen said as he stood up 	8.167891431411016

 —yes sir 	8.905811526627181

 thanks sargent answered 	28.99281483832163

 he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench 	5.027311257730322

 —you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form 	7.938473239289156

 —yes sir 	8.905811526627181

 in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield 	7.2529931844457725

 —sargent —run on stephen said 	7.697639249955467

 mr deasy is calling you 	10.69321736321004

 he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife 	4.614409232394679

 they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet 	3.398511285365821

 when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him 	4.850161184198772

 —what is it now 	8.276658408901007

 he cried continually without listening 	9.371032286966305

 —cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said 	5.450905171142661

 —will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here 	4.9211250615852675

 and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly —what is the matter 	6.093112127063004

 what is it now 	12.24636118815216

 their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head 	3.6298839423112743

 stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs 	6.800352271251978

 as on the first day he bargained with me here 	11.129713824048151

 as it was in the beginning is now 	15.124169530567228

 on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be 	3.622257449981218

 and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end 	3.271155306580713

 a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor 	10.833644580832921

 blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table 	7.622616511862738

 —first our little financial settlement he said 	3.707307849122749

 he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong 	8.41051564890755

 it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table 	5.054682759943059

 —two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away 	5.094778610488478

 and now his strongroom for the gold 	9.735902129083458

 stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emir’s turban and this the scallop of saint james 	3.8158808394442705

 an old pilgrim’s hoard dead treasure hollow shells 	7.186945395783251

 a sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth 	9.388664595398149

 —three mr deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand 	5.284966850797551

 these are handy things to have 	5.887606567157238

 this is for sovereigns 	17.647771985363065

 this is for shillings 	17.647771985363065

 sixpences halfcrowns 	209.41671971432194

 and here crowns 	45.655507748463656

 he shot from it two crowns and two shillings 	5.220380955521887

 —three twelve he said 	8.598439731803008

 i think you’ll find that’s right 	9.861665171151218

 —thank you sir stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers 	4.755327406082988

 —no thanks at all mr deasy said 	4.978555797108398

 you have earned it 	14.956072596467092

 stephen’s hand free again went back to the hollow shells 	8.40393850483334

 symbols too of beauty and of power 	14.969314384208037

 a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery 	4.771208719644814

 —don’t carry it like that mr deasy said 	8.027419078283586

 you’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it 	7.715963726473402

 you just buy one of these machines 	11.744838576944481

 you’ll find them very handy 	6.859466896884546

 i can break them in this instant if i will 	10.702004789195195

 —because you don’t save mr deasy said pointing his finger 	5.884724382755839

 you don’t know yet what money is 	5.41177670625465

 money is power 	28.6284267584821

 put but money in thy purse 	6.259993003393286

 —iago stephen murmured 	13.666574521116818

 he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare 	12.263494830986096

 —he knew what money was mr deasy said 	8.151075429818214

 he made money 	46.26728963737986

 a poet yes but an englishman too 	8.704558260682889

 do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman’s mouth 	6.650837952574347

 the seas’ ruler 	10.2854175957695

 his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating 	5.729224862177325

 —that on his empire stephen said the sun never sets 	11.526131955413257

 —ba mr deasy cried 	18.52763062634525

 that’s not english 	13.34263488834111

 a french celt said that 	9.660573926042778

 he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail 	6.0872748636199265

 —i will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast 	6.781885252856478

 i paid my way 	8.27696954759586

 —for the moment no stephen answered 	11.20660472998683

 mr deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox 	4.728900722034283

 —i knew you couldn’t he said joyously 	10.801549409369912

 but one day you must feel it 	10.461805990587221

 we are a generous people but we must also be just 	4.2178538024115895

 —i fear those big words stephen said which make us so unhappy 	5.273631059800985

 mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward prince of wales 	4.663409097995459

 —you think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said 	5.396974999944417

 sit down a moment 	31.008513173139693

 i have just to copy the end 	7.05469915585271

 he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter 	7.889858989988003

 —sit down 	22.827025127448863

 excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense 	5.153627443990709

 just a moment 	17.727383522890932

 he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error 	3.9660999923756064

 stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence 	5.9611652894976785

 framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord hastings’ repulse the duke of westminster’s shotover the duke of beaufort’s ceylon prix de paris 1866 	2.631556752011604

 elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign 	8.202900709036896

 he saw their speeds backing king’s colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds 	5.201382408875107

 —full stop mr deasy bade his keys 	6.780238810223229

 but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question 	7.655873623622105

 ten to one the field 	13.695642255731002

 dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butcher’s dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange 	2.594280208883104

 shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle 	8.172312987072292

 again a goal 	45.44479475260904

 —now then mr deasy said rising 	7.466712142556178

 he came to the table pinning together his sheets 	7.0024608401349795

 stephen stood up 	18.129889367134815

 —i have put the matter into a nutshell mr deasy said 	7.242186052791463

 it’s about the foot and mouth disease 	7.534299073091139

 it is cured 	39.39329460678412

 my cousin blackwood price writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there 	3.088452624083351

 they offer to come over here 	10.262372989049362

 now i’m going to try publicity 	13.11384958183862

 backstairs influence by 	35.26475749699104

 he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke 	5.1266484280737785

 —mark my words mr dedalus he said 	9.05441857123495

 england is in the hands of the jews 	30.147937351478244

 in all the highest places her finance her press 	8.00162230723683

 and they are the signs of a nation’s decay 	20.845376349772813

 wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength 	7.903267750933315

 i have seen it coming these years 	5.970115664342208

 as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction 	5.003745592322184

 old england is dying 	16.80889798133863

 he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam 	6.08614266348393

 he faced about and back again 	6.234212258858553

 —dying he said again if not dead by now 	7.65521746970593

 the harlot’s cry from street to street shall weave old england’s windingsheet 	5.2481316311456965

 his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted 	4.461005933110788

 —a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not 	3.6355470602879216

 —they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely 	7.241062223333095

 and you can see the darkness in their eyes 	15.6301226716903

 and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day 	10.139684432490897

 on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers 	4.061135133158631

 gabble of geese 	35.26475749699104

 they swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats 	3.4354738983638304

 not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures 	3.8733209900635908

 their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain 	2.2668499634045913

 vain patience to heap and hoard 	5.427692353071911

 time surely would scatter all 	7.4987020539078975

 a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on 	5.251473829150163

 their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh 	3.565331593998648

 —who has not 	15.390065521582569

 stephen said 	55.30511046438131

 —what do you mean 	15.965003986597436

 he came forward a pace and stood by the table 	9.545818086075661

 his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly 	5.342910206831763

 is this old wisdom 	32.91607796257763

 he waits to hear from me 	9.768215770878468

 —history stephen said is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake 	9.906780270852922

 from the playfield the boys raised a shout 	6.177753342060269

 a whirring whistle goal 	12.043110257884106

 what if that nightmare gave you a back kick 	7.5123054546088035

 —the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said 	5.231351867124644

 all human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of god 	2.529138087006561

 stephen jerked his thumb towards the window saying —that is god 	10.659166501966522

 hooray ay whrrwhee —what 	8.480169657860364

 —a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders 	7.386921462510331

 mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers 	6.175684455312954

 looking up again he set them free 	12.638240356731805

 —i am happier than you are he said 	6.849001218917609

 we have committed many errors and many sins 	5.002475879861091

 a woman brought sin into the world 	7.09881889042034

 for a woman who was no better than she should be helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks made war on troy 	3.479290686946014

 a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here macmurrough’s wife and her leman o’rourke prince of breffni 	4.3413896875325

 a woman too brought parnell low 	6.486542893795141

 many errors many failures but not the one sin 	8.43335191103341

 i am a struggler now at the end of my days 	7.066730388017959

 but i will fight for the right till the end 	17.307242340287885

 for ulster will fight and ulster will be right 	7.222400350327872

 stephen raised the sheets in his hand 	8.536103124613806

 —well sir he began 	8.643309923314728

 —i foresee mr deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work 	4.17827495329068

 you were not born to be a teacher i think 	7.718420719408141

 perhaps i am wrong 	35.09934986605268

 —a learner rather stephen said 	5.272361669938799

 and here what will you learn more 	11.031704987496099

 mr deasy shook his head 	11.212402051583004

 —who knows 	28.919028964825017

 to learn one must be humble 	15.512653217951076

 but life is the great teacher 	28.187668899649516

 stephen rustled the sheets again 	10.416926849941019

 —as regards these he began 	6.9167725560697955

 —yes mr deasy said 	9.248940261666473

 you have two copies there 	8.706709443884536

 if you can have them published at once 	6.401839896567563

 —i will try stephen said and let you know tomorrow 	10.406654640481827

 i know two editors slightly 	9.288242759465192

 —that will do mr deasy said briskly 	5.237010955820869

 i wrote last night to mr field <initial> <initial> there is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the city arms hotel 	7.061767795461558

 i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting 	7.658189592856704

 you see if you can get it into your two papers 	10.679728963937455

 what are they 	49.142702238270616

 —the evening telegraph 	16.956051823001307

 —that will do mr deasy said 	4.710199593433039

 there is no time to lose 	12.122519691395677

 now i have to answer that letter from my cousin 	10.020650895961058

 —good morning sir stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket 	5.371886415889243

 thank you 	54.54467084455385

 —not at all mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk 	5.9643451878692195

 i like to break a lance with you old as i am 	6.712284333335035

 —good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back 	5.391845051430656

 he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield 	5.081425081839977

 the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors 	8.472519740961264

 still i will help him in his fight 	17.22816100586654

 mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard 	6.167327976803302

 —mr dedalus running after me 	12.676450865608947

 no more letters i hope 	8.954131914272459

 —just one moment 	15.624308990037605

 mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath 	4.03893572800108

 —i just wanted to say he said 	11.079997072179804

 ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews 	5.069648562383693

 do you know that 	9.986433405318127

 and do you know why 	34.09413468478014

 he frowned sternly on the bright air 	14.548599009402716

 —why sir 	26.50094323612325

 stephen asked beginning to smile 	8.88825196192828

 —because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly 	8.876888252006992

 a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm 	4.691970856397591

 he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air 	3.449891395419647

 —she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path 	5.739453980963733

 that’s why 	16.40711325858569

 on his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins 	5.154510115087251

 <number> ineluctable modality of the visible at least that if no more thought through my eyes 	5.98314495491406

 their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand trotting sniffing on all sides 	3.394266037285273

 looking for something lost in a past life 	11.970616400806204

 suddenly he made off like a bounding hare ears flung back chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull 	4.617694515897839

 the man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears 	6.007690681536843

 on a field tenney a buck trippant proper unattired 	6.052760537739809

 at the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs seawardpointed ears 	7.016088592094896

 his snout lifted barked at the wavenoise herds of seamorse 	5.434813425528657

 they serpented towards his feet curling unfurling many crests every ninth breaking plashing from far from farther out waves and waves 	2.648501759855866

 they waded a little way in the water and stooping soused their bags and lifting them again waded out 	3.8207313411903137

 the dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning 	3.7013399061583803

 unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws 	6.001479933789321

 his speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop 	7.853743575864051

 —tatters out of that you mongrel the cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand crouched in flight 	4.153041342584726

 he slunk back in a curve 	17.579677315662373

 doesn’t see me 	12.87672174390073

 along by the edge of the mole he lolloped dawdled smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it 	5.346321652185332

 he trotted forward and lifting again his hindleg pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock 	3.614639897631247

 the simple pleasures of the poor 	15.665181293457971

 his hindpaws then scattered the sand then his forepaws dabbled and delved 	2.940999697441877

 something he buried there his grandmother 	8.001550204311085

 he rooted in the sand dabbling delving and stopped to listen to the air scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws soon ceasing a pard a panther got in spousebreach vulturing the dead 	4.360280990275837

 he lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket his hat tilted down on his eyes 	3.2742142050525986

 under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms hising up their petticoats in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds 	2.0252896376278335

 perhaps there is someone 	34.00485053646888

 he turned his face over a shoulder rere regardant 	6.853881277544637

 moving through the air high spars of a threemaster her sails brailed up on the crosstrees homing upstream silently moving a silent ship 	4.221825018635825

 — ii — <number> mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls 	3.818558070269169

 he liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods’ roes 	2.016915048988649

 most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine 	3.9333266492421086

 kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray 	8.45047391432626

 gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere 	5.980161039492011

 made him feel a bit peckish 	30.87842430232886

 the coals were reddening 	12.50806960258624

 another slice of bread and butter three four right 	6.257805085468621

 she didn’t like her plate full 	7.001179061311498

 he turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire 	6.244580073462667

 —mkgnao —o there you are mr bloom said turning from the fire 	8.129549884047016

 the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table mewing 	4.205119080223482

 just how she stalks over my writingtable 	4.661652537028813

 mr bloom watched curiously kindly the lithe black form 	3.277825212539875

 clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes 	5.346082927774011

 he bent down to her his hands on his knees 	11.185596506682835

 —milk for the pussens he said 	11.774946771047444

 —mrkgnao the cat cried 	15.051715488443648

 they call them stupid 	22.892739912072575

 they understand what we say better than we understand them 	5.425115197083729

 she understands all she wants to 	7.3955391456966

 vindictive too 	209.41671971432194

 her nature 	140.49118228514124

 curious mice never squeal 	12.209560327491568

 seem to like it 	24.372372933308043

 wonder what i look like to her 	18.395785471794124

 height of a tower 	53.75187460383564

 no she can jump me 	8.608520948276121

 —afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly 	18.16994300246814

 i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens 	7.95274848982342

 —mrkrgnao the cat said loudly 	9.579032949910248

 she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth 	3.5570577857659837

 then he went to the dresser took the jug hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor 	5.06280184985328

 —gurrhr she cried running to lap 	7.016514379338369

 he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly 	4.726522189197549

 wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after 	6.508085969914233

 or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps 	15.373241867304278

 he listened to her licking lap 	14.582516433167505

 ham and eggs no 	17.306960509297685

 no good eggs with this drouth 	9.851663403412303

 want pure fresh water 	14.089578020338609

 thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckley’ <initial> fried with butter a shake of pepper 	5.4130423847324645

 better a pork kidney at dlugacz’ <initial> while the kettle is boiling 	5.383034901332657

 she lapped slower then licking the saucer clean 	3.9091939980291244

 why are their tongues so rough 	6.890941595380751

 to lap better all porous holes 	5.394448585467648

 he glanced round him 	12.485263694821013

 on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door 	7.592230882774758

 she might like something tasty 	9.436025809165157

 still perhaps once in a way 	9.488118576348043

 he said softly in the bare hall —i’m going round the corner 	7.489339054552425

 be back in a minute 	19.69152830523758

 and when he had heard his voice say it he added —you don’t want anything for breakfast 	6.539737522782152

 a sleepy soft grunt answered —mn 	5.053281829043683

 she didn’t want anything 	9.422997319093671

 he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled 	6.706712725299357

 must get those settled really 	7.935694785378453

 all the way from gibraltar 	22.613082164733253

 forgotten any little spanish she knew 	5.938413718914424

 wonder what her father gave for it 	8.320056044128563

 old style 	141.26952567352495

 ah yes of course 	12.178484910153777

 bought it at the governor’s auction 	25.81568054867514

 got a short knock 	21.429236760177627

 hard as nails at a bargain old tweedy 	6.7144547074632746

 at plevna that was 	12.869527450279634

 still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps 	7.724099409776992

 his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof 	5.146449261183873

 stamps stickyback pictures 	35.26475749699104

 daresay lots of officers are in the swim too 	9.572115635786753

 course they do 	31.433320966021256

 the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely plasto’s high grade ha 	8.980233099256163

 he peeped quickly inside the leather headband 	4.63609511554704

 white slip of paper 	13.71383418871118

 quite safe 	158.15711212064988

 on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey 	9.9569804855266

 not there 	159.15451356945397

 in the trousers i left off 	16.6327623477003

 potato i have 	35.26475749699104

 creaky wardrobe 	209.41671971432194

 no use disturbing her 	12.730939146208348

 she turned over sleepily that time 	8.51972361538845

 he pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid 	3.417951667009368

 looked shut 	172.9342353939454

 all right till i come back anyhow 	19.12468183592992

 he crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive 	5.961707171001913

 the sun was nearing the steeple of george’s church 	5.644229431025936

 be a warm day i fancy 	16.90120045194091

 specially in these black clothes feel it more 	5.006487680360793

 black conducts reflects refracts is it 	5.323945394643546

 the heat 	156.4518051831419

 but i couldn’t go in that light suit 	10.060816047564991

 make a picnic of it 	11.63988536407265

 his eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth 	4.7593440359677555

 makes you feel young 	20.296437801402003

 somewhere in the east early morning set off at dawn 	9.369714822890817

 travel round in front of the sun steal a day’s march on him 	8.403682129055493

 keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically 	7.726799319894421

 walk along a strand strange land come to a city gate sentry there old ranker too old tweedy’s big moustaches leaning on a long kind of a spear 	4.562306130543449

 wander through awned streets 	20.37899151159378

 turbaned faces going by 	14.471237670438626

 dark caves of carpet shops big man turko the terrible seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe 	2.183352381247965

 cries of sellers in the streets 	25.23606574229498

 drink water scented with fennel sherbet 	6.608614927011029

 well meet him 	28.920756365296473

 getting on to sundown 	46.973274437625776

 the shadows of the mosques among the pillars priest with a scroll rolled up 	7.281312945050564

 a shiver of the trees signal the evening wind 	13.122576890816882

 i pass on 	22.96319366192351

 fading gold sky 	35.26475749699104

 a mother watches me from her doorway 	14.764955119881613

 she calls her children home in their dark language 	8.193151500741104

 high wall beyond strings twanged 	7.275514791223365

 night sky moon violet colour of molly’s new garters 	5.91048857428557

 a girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them dulcimers 	6.478369650008696

 i pass 	110.03945549829331

 probably not a bit like it really 	18.04081766209011

 kind of stuff you read in the track of the sun 	12.794512933211935

 sunburst on the titlepage 	80.22802392668652

 he smiled pleasing himself 	12.179133027852886

 what arthur griffith said about the headpiece over the freeman leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of ireland 	4.681126052044923

 he prolonged his pleased smile 	7.874554173963332

 ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest 	5.332618814298701

 he approached larry o’rourke’ <initial> from the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter 	5.51027614600448

 through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush 	4.23718849529535

 good house however just the end of the city traffic 	8.669096112259046

 for instance m’auley’s down there <initial> <initial> as position 	11.279854578878327

 of course if they ran a tramline along the north circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot 	5.525911877861163

 cute old codger 	31.039924200854312

 no use canvassing him for an ad 	8.507635492509381

 still he knows his own business best 	9.844201268922745

 there he is sure enough my bold larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket 	3.3500166378026885

 simon dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up 	8.290553894004004

 what’s that mr o’rourke 	11.372672587017993

 do you know what 	9.215475134551708

 the russians they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the japanese 	7.095717419684535

 stop and say a word about the funeral perhaps 	11.202390757039927

 turning into dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway —good day mr o’rourke 	5.07773950562129

 —good day to you 	8.146184094217041

 —lovely weather sir 	16.252387658227025

 where do they get the money 	14.547819613776602

 coming up redheaded curates from the county leitrim rinsing empties and old man in the cellar 	6.508478388464778

 then lo and behold they blossom out as adam findlaters or dan tallons 	2.3095910442011065

 then think of the competition 	53.10567229907165

 general thirst 	140.6878877950423

 good puzzle would be cross dublin without passing a pub 	4.734937432899885

 put down three and carry five 	11.604636427041076

 on the wholesale orders perhaps 	14.766128731015444

 doing a double shuffle with the town travellers 	12.164491356940207

 square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job see 	8.00141516394754

 how much would that tot to off the porter in the month 	6.788226310603757

 say ten barrels of stuff 	9.284656385766905

 say he got ten per cent off 	12.55807180043195

 he passed saint joseph’s national school 	10.477105895726488

 brats’ clamour 	35.26475749699104

 slieve bloom 	209.41671971432194

 he halted before dlugacz’s window staring at the hanks of sausages polonies black and white 	4.591691370282829

 fifteen multiplied by 	28.6284267584821

 the figures whitened in his mind unsolved displeased he let them fade 	6.243843760468249

 a kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish the last 	5.368137515400181

 he stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter 	11.942039149377438

 would she buy it too calling the items from a slip in her hand 	5.215369072787188

 chapped washingsoda 	209.41671971432194

 and a pound and a half of denny’s sausages 	13.287773762817599

 his eyes rested on her vigorous hips 	10.142777233563619

 wonder what he does 	18.322922375214052

 the way her crooked skirt swings at each whack 	6.394825373322516

 the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers sausagepink 	4.1070678638370595

 sound meat there like a stallfed heifer 	10.28694747962868

 he took a page up from the pile of cut sheets the model farm at kinnereth on the lakeshore of tiberias 	3.3585390210581556

 a young white heifer 	18.094729782899144

 those mornings in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens branded sheep flop and fall of dung the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter there’s a prime one unpeeled switches in their hands 	2.9097498656886507

 he held the page aslant patiently bending his senses and his will his soft subject gaze at rest 	3.24479728430506

 the crooked skirt swinging whack by whack by whack 	3.175393904476543

 the porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace 	4.593086968073913

 —now my miss he said 	5.613356512590163

 she tendered a coin smiling boldly holding her thick wrist out 	3.0573250603693376

 —thank you my miss 	13.597941355371086

 she stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right 	4.999196669523652

 sodachapped hands 	209.41671971432194

 crusted toenails too 	35.26475749699104

 brown scapulars in tatters defending her both ways 	3.6263543959639737

 the sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast 	2.5737222571142184

 his hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket 	3.253612196702105

 then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles 	5.152212229889084

 they lay were read quickly and quickly slid disc by disc into the till 	3.5081275395964546

 —thank you sir 	8.192895795697314

 a speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him 	3.2724148185341395

 he withdrew his gaze after an instant 	6.6206019404007215

 no better not another time 	16.333077646005904

 folding the page into his pocket he turned into eccles street hurrying homeward 	6.086225503251686

 cold oils slid along his veins chilling his blood age crusting him with a salt cloak 	3.3120735470014586

 runs she runs to meet me a girl with gold hair on the wind 	11.718061604714004

 two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor 	17.218759388608895

 he stooped and gathered them 	8.388330588865365

 mrs marion bloom 	12.517421561283713

 his quickened heart slowed at once 	5.342910206831763

 mrs marion 	41.59227984162155

 —poldy entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head 	3.1682391718546334

 —who are the letters for 	16.343564943807063

 he looked at them 	10.588831452142912

 —a letter for me from milly he said carefully and a card to you 	8.851660422569319

 and a letter for you 	23.945038006427993

 he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees 	5.894147906201555

 —do you want the blind up 	7.9788499266220665

 letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow 	3.6448928127266087

 —that do 	30.682911075127492

 he asked turning 	24.221884233117766

 she was reading the card propped on her elbow 	10.486797327554537

 —she got the things she said 	10.368938394696766

 he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh 	5.8353984391335265

 —hurry up with that tea she said 	8.360773463276981

 i’m parched 	15.3339228817215

 —the kettle is boiling he said 	4.785687818141752

 but he delayed to clear the chair her striped petticoat tossed soiled linen and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed 	3.8529807449096958

 as he went down the kitchen stairs she called —poldy —what 	7.418695527883932

 —scald the teapot 	13.666574521116818

 he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in 	4.779702178884418

 having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt 	5.129835850762819

 while he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him 	4.063193029011724

 give her too much meat she won’t mouse 	8.516473737077908

 say they won’t eat pork 	13.650807613536895

 he let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce 	4.293782006980144

 he sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup 	7.444800102304254

 then he slit open his letter glancing down the page and over 	4.72031091678537

 thanks new tam mr coghlan lough owel picnic young student blazes boylan’s seaside girls 	4.036349730270658

 the tea was drawn 	19.576186861491127

 he filled his own moustachecup sham crown derby smiling 	6.673986734186244

 silly milly’s birthday gift 	19.077858916519926

 i gave her the amberoid necklace she broke 	5.3493391130633325

 putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her 	7.210677549583914

 he smiled pouring 	28.021314134722655

 o milly bloom you are my darling 	10.549129839427527

 you are my lookingglass from night to morning 	4.180381867805021

 i’d rather have you without a farthing than katey keogh with her ass and garden 	4.372547735404066

 poor old professor goodwin 	16.715313015788034

 dreadful old case 	31.039924200854312

 still he was a courteous old chap 	12.60272236152697

 oldfashioned way he used to bow molly off the platform 	8.225564884917471

 and the little mirror in his silk hat 	13.7173047324592

 the night milly brought it into the parlour 	12.008739384821814

 o look what i found in professor goodwin’s hat all we laughed 	7.706156170681785

 sex breaking out even then 	9.74115693607997

 pert little piece she was 	9.74115693607997

 he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray 	4.4897613106200325

 its hump bumped as he took it up 	8.102339435403994

 everything on it 	36.069557498385265

 bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream 	4.958786515712264

 he carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle 	7.379931345893799

 nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead 	8.424002257428869

 —what a time you were she said 	12.392455669219142

 she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow 	4.9067322206124935

 he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder 	4.698420042155869

 the warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured 	9.012192628210236

 a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow 	4.419577201481102

 in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread 	4.168102706447662

 —who was the letter from 	28.142473283216006

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 —o boylan she said 	7.433455151892415

 — là ci darem with <initial> <initial> doyle she said and love’s old sweet song  	6.57831726389818

 her full lips drinking smiled 	9.99183875686259

 rather stale smell that incense leaves next day 	3.7926577588025583

 like foul flowerwater 	29.548657677787705

 —would you like the window open a little 	11.904598833826032

 she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking —what time is the funeral 	5.15668544851457

 —eleven i think he answered 	12.293654098439836

 i didn’t see the paper 	10.129974366967394

 following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed 	9.614847512140864

 then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole 	3.159528942569597

 —no that book 	19.77356412249661

 other stocking 	145.7251444230266

 her petticoat 	140.49118228514124

 —it must have fell down she said 	7.633321090370703

 he felt here and there 	9.602961317688528

 voglio e non vorrei  	9.6082107725459

 wonder if she pronounces that right voglio  	6.920391859538393

 not in the bed 	54.00155261234195

 must have slid down 	20.330926127450205

 he stooped and lifted the valance 	9.341492699075845

 the book fallen sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot 	10.50799304408576

 —show here she said 	8.140710032961941

 i put a mark in it 	14.101423177802562

 there’s a word i wanted to ask you 	11.121277614760087

 she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word 	3.7640851369376107

 —met him what 	30.29190948757018

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 —here she said 	12.208406914274098

 what does that mean 	9.318993731852771

 he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail 	5.405791348822593

 who’s he when he’s at home 	11.762386494296514

 —metempsychosis he said frowning 	15.63906474234954

 it’s greek from the greek 	13.762022564366136

 that means the transmigration of souls 	5.618367640700822

 —o rocks she said 	9.808502877297567

 he smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes 	5.314740940554667

 the same young eyes 	30.96578091478666

 the first night after the charades 	17.650426117084894

 —did you finish it 	9.827709236435506

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 —yes she said 	16.747663701760068

 there’s nothing smutty in it 	7.237201899698729

 —some people believe he said that we go on living in another body after death that we lived before 	4.478556240884642

 they call it reincarnation 	30.847919365500236

 that we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet 	6.896152578314028

 some say they remember their past lives 	6.461007703066648

 the sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea 	3.47259072786925

 better remind her of the word metempsychosis 	14.649360844040318

 an example would be better 	11.479254475937674

 he turned the pages back 	12.30482230683844

 —metempsychosis he said is what the ancient greeks called it 	7.381975117551139

 they used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree for instance 	5.736570276545042

 what they called nymphs for example 	14.369321848980835

 her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar 	7.749764538762744

 —there’s a smell of burn she said 	5.273599356160299

 did you leave anything on the fire 	13.169663682490432

 —the kidney he cried suddenly 	9.188870650700924

 he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs 	4.35806181848165

 pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan 	8.453424176825463

 by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back 	5.528517757129081

 only a little burnt 	42.84465663031658

 he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it 	5.152850880556304

 cup of tea now 	24.764918751247418

 he sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf 	7.905979924861351

 he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat 	7.524970989110301

 then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat 	3.7542586644596256

 done to a turn 	53.870933239354954

 a mouthful of tea 	12.043110257884106

 then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth 	5.504981957629379

 what was that about some young student and a picnic 	9.484060892801587

 he creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth 	5.20545010568487

 he went in bowing his head under the low lintel 	7.1504521969800185

 leaving the door ajar amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces 	3.048281556207871

 before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows 	6.395119870567697

 the king was in his countinghouse 	30.539860403068392

 asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper turning its pages over on his bared knees 	5.284732553190903

 the mirror was in shadow 	28.70732513623899

 she rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub 	3.6438779856083094

 peering into it 	35.26475749699104

 lines in her eyes 	26.680820543665995

 day then the night 	28.574187839849614

 he tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it 	3.382018753952925

 then he girded up his trousers braced and buttoned himself 	4.935043948006266

 he pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air 	6.381084925196232

 in the bright light lightened and cooled in limb he eyed carefully his black trousers the ends the knees the houghs of the knees 	3.5581214895509174

 and past the sailors’ home 	8.115639539398819

 he turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through lime street 	8.673102888857128

 by brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled his bucket of offal linked smoking a chewed fagbutt 	4.329560784514385

 a smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him listlessly holding her battered caskhoop 	2.5066020807194693

 he crossed townsend street passed the frowning face of bethel 	4.686250967955438

 and past nichols’ the undertaker 	7.425223652453698

 at eleven it is 	12.869527450279634

 time enough 	56.31448552453714

 in westland row he halted before the window of the belfast and oriental tea company and read the legends of leadpapered packets choice blend finest quality family tea 	3.2292553556378767

 rather warm 	146.3051524102258

 must get some from tom kernan 	5.989137100907586

 couldn’t ask him at a funeral though 	11.111912222326563

 while his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair 	3.972764878319637

 very warm morning 	27.31741161694852

 under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha 	4.896360332122985

 just there 	154.6588052373492

 his right hand came down into the bowl of his hat 	9.227317245272413

 his fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket 	5.091294511340852

 so warm 	158.93217985969613

 his right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair 	5.322672925279592

 then he put on his hat again relieved and read again choice blend made of the finest ceylon brands 	5.521435585614819

 the far east 	29.034903414560628

 lovely spot it must be the garden of the world big lazy leaves to float about on cactuses flowery meads snaky lianas they call them 	2.906978879478498

 sleep six months out of twelve 	18.16278127664831

 too hot to quarrel 	12.981623659098805

 they all fall to the ground 	16.028891336107424

 it’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight 	8.436841757273763

 he turned away and sauntered across the road 	6.27338163978438

 how did she walk with her sausages 	11.230264522113012

 like that something 	44.06413637344497

 he handed the card through the brass grill 	11.22037370338621

 —are there any letters for me 	6.3133697869936345

 he asked 	22.523316228137833

 while the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils smelling freshprinted rag paper 	3.540644323718387

 no answer probably 	20.028587222996226

 went too far last time 	11.21515172029571

 the postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter 	7.381797262960961

 he thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope 	9.098482976435898

 henry flower esq c/o <initial> <initial> westland row city 	5.60068907848294

 a mason yes 	27.604817689259878

 his hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope ripping it open in jerks 	6.832328069111642

 women will pay a lot of heed i don’t think 	4.891138982627998

 his fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket 	4.984151015643849

 nice enough in its way for a little ballad 	17.023014406068388

 no guts in it 	14.733906927982417

 you and me don’t you know in the same boat 	11.516674686128143

 that day o dear o dear ffoo well perhaps it was best for him 	5.755570598589974

 mr bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard 	7.723861117093623

 no use thinking of it any more 	11.896718291356988

 nosebag time 	209.41671971432194

 wish i hadn’t met that m’coy fellow 	6.95332159412729

 he came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth 	2.9647592930979876

 their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss 	4.772843288055752

 their eldorado 	144.13415544142347

 poor jugginses damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags 	4.194872862819422

 too full for words 	9.919877942872503

 still they get their feed all right and their doss 	8.282401785771809

 gelded too a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches 	4.150534307645716

 might be happy all the same that way 	9.45898443100737

 good poor brutes they look 	8.350159177181704

 still their neigh can be very irritating 	6.921742508578229

 he drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried 	6.376815126708089

 might just walk into her here 	9.145745143448298

 he passed the cabman’s shelter 	11.807739553778175

 all weathers all places time or setdown no will of their own 	2.9859295017893372

 voglio e non  	20.426315171871458

 shout a few flying syllables as they pass 	10.093759818410321

 he hummed là ci darem la mano la la lala la la 	2.7536854807193385

 he turned into cumberland street and going on some paces halted in the lee of the station wall 	6.719755318774316

 no one 	29.468891382507284

 meade’s timberyard 	88.53243671347653

 piled balks 	172.9342353939454

 ruins and tenements 	35.26475749699104

 with careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone 	4.660151902405623

 not a sinner 	44.49573844253852

 near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles alone shooting the taw with a cunnythumb 	3.5163623598078178

 a wise tabby a blinking sphinx watched from her warm sill 	3.7194366116150177

 pity to disturb them 	19.108994598031614

 mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her 	8.471789860833757

 open it 	149.07336339065603

 and once i played marbles when i went to that old dame’s school 	8.463721876812293

 he opened the letter within the newspaper 	11.804768684361825

 a flower 	145.03650468355337

 i think it’s <initial> a yellow flower with flattened petals 	6.91097017010486

 not annoyed then 	29.36833371064165

 what does she say 	18.390697296669586

 dear henry i got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it 	5.61585694961152

 i am sorry you did not like my last letter 	9.661596536323499

 i want to know 	10.59747409423392

 he tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket 	3.746702685489105

 language of flowers 	68.89142928015544

 they like it because no one can hear 	9.30249620142985

 or a poison bouquet to strike him down 	6.752487102923859

 then walking slowly forward he read the letter again murmuring here and there a word 	4.39364422759282

 angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how i long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife martha’s perfume 	2.6524324122601324

 having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket 	10.265014252334623

 weak joy opened his lips 	9.321863525621287

 changed since the first letter 	31.591978043636257

 doing the indignant a girl of good family like me respectable character 	4.892986585939102

 thank you not having any 	14.10409900181525

 usual love scrimmage 	31.039924200854312

 then running round corners 	16.807837745917247

 bad as a row with molly 	19.10083490376036

 try it anyhow 	19.81673780458626

 a bit at a time 	20.19584250801061

 fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it 	8.654613853217947

 common pin eh 	35.26475749699104

 he threw it on the road 	12.81589102411881

 out of her clothes somewhere pinned together 	9.788522226319303

 queer the number of pins they always have 	6.299956906328954

 no roses without thorns 	12.389689518422285

 flat dublin voices bawled in his head 	7.717862154563731

 those two sluts that night in the coombe linked together in the rain 	8.394578306872353

 o mairy lost the pin of her drawers 	6.623211438607827

 eyefocus bad for stomach nerves 	11.700341611173345

 what perfume does your wife use 	4.327818325897995

 now could you make out a thing like that 	6.816353688251209

 his sharp voice said 	12.349995894116317

 —i say you can keep it mr bloom answered 	9.141155648156252

 he foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full naked in a womb of warmth oiled by scented melting soap softly laved 	3.3205041464487404

 he saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained buoyed lightly upward lemonyellow his navel bud of flesh and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands a languid floating flower 	3.2243005145621004

 <number> martin cunningham first poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and entering deftly seated himself 	3.731586079321091

 mr bloom entered and sat in the vacant place 	13.638583773894812

 he pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight 	4.767479408277924

 he passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue 	6.613434159012646

 one dragged aside an old woman peeping 	8.038290795669399

 nothing was said 	36.45209584471525

 stowing in the wreaths probably 	39.44556804065996

 all waited 	91.70137841889027

 then wheels were heard from in front turning then nearer then horses’ hoofs 	3.079039674272993

 a jolt 	145.03650468355337

 their carriage began to move creaking and swaying 	7.206395281247115

 other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind 	4.583075352907237

 the blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker door ajar 	3.8547614157994334

 at walking pace 	30.158990518631565

 they waited still their knees jogging till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks 	4.989294312009343

 tritonville road 	209.41671971432194

 the wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes 	6.2330005795151875

 —what way is he taking us 	9.966569031742436

 mr power asked through both windows 	5.319404594325576

 —irishtown martin cunningham said 	8.739083140727656

 brunswick street 	209.41671971432194

 mr dedalus nodded looking out 	7.843386040007031

 —that’s a fine old custom he said 	4.488277518945878

 i am glad to see it has not died out 	8.700928939474823

 all watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers 	2.857164924006846

 the carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past watery lane 	5.903828836324269

 mr bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man clad in mourning a wide hat 	4.78507318358205

 —there’s a friend of yours gone by dedalus he said 	4.099593062064822

 —who is that 	11.82241579067873

 —your son and heir 	10.22897077115045

 —where is he 	9.589903863492042

 mr dedalus said stretching over across 	5.3321513209433675

 the carriage passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses lurched round the corner and swerving back to the tramtrack rolled on noisily with chattering wheels 	2.8069654671683617

 mr dedalus fell back saying —was that mulligan cad with him 	6.298597691930224

 —down with his aunt sally i suppose mr dedalus said the goulding faction the drunken little costdrawer and crissie papa’s little lump of dung the wise child that knows her own father 	3.6681111407579263

 —he’s in with a lowdown crowd mr dedalus snarled 	9.58028724574245

 that mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts 	5.745086913761733

 his name stinks all over dublin 	13.552639778668047

 but with the help of god and his blessed mother i’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate 	5.973724469321092

 i’ll tickle his catastrophe believe you me 	3.832617539985032

 —corny might have given us a more commodious yoke mr power said 	4.753855410159195

 —he might mr dedalus said if he hadn’t that squint troubling him 	7.164918026227789

 he closed his left eye 	13.825454054047286

 martin cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs 	5.721606148709001

 —what is this he said in the name of god 	8.406309870513278

 —someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately mr power said 	4.287346056075064

 all raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats 	3.956401041843061

 mr dedalus twisting his nose frowned downward and said —unless i’m greatly mistaken 	5.321802900696121

 —after all he said it’s the most natural thing in the world 	11.351176449758348

 —did tom kernan turn up 	8.159776704428724

 his eyes passed lightly over mr power’s goodlooking face 	6.927684667438602

 greyish over the ears 	36.7547868600217

 madame smiling 	209.41671971432194

 i smiled back 	33.118656191794976

 only politeness perhaps 	28.520731531776185

 nice fellow 	141.42913157691495

 martin cunningham nudged mr power 	10.051252139605154

 —of the tribe of reuben he said 	7.775613938412807

 a tall blackbearded figure bent on a stick stumping round the corner of elvery’s elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine 	4.050387627822695

 —in all his pristine beauty mr power said 	6.734347417566416

 mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly —the devil break the hasp of your back mr power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray’s statue 	5.2015785176548235

 —we have all been there martin cunningham said broadly 	7.907160704928718

 his eyes met mr bloom’s eyes 	12.426256832257618

 he caressed his beard adding —well nearly all of us 	5.780083738901873

 mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces 	5.691095382869229

 —that’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about reuben j and the son 	5.50703398527947

 —about the boatman 	41.58338627039052

 mr power asked 	22.45860186278581

 isn’t it awfully good 	7.303101642075051

 —what is that 	9.773536495511994

 mr dedalus asked 	19.20368889955934

 i didn’t hear it 	8.53263888054831

 —there was a girl in the case mr bloom began and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harm’s way but when they were both 	8.018885240432615

 mr dedalus asked 	19.20368889955934

 that confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it 	5.618367640700822

 they were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown 	12.72776688550534

 —drown barabbas mr dedalus cried 	10.344095397327653

 i wish to christ he did mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils 	5.83817049051664

 martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely —reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey 	5.177949041524144

 —for god’s sake mr dedalus exclaimed in fright 	8.711691465296386

 is he dead 	45.36140904108262

 —dead martin cunningham cried 	19.55587987506659

 not he a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive 	6.994823270070089

 half the town was there 	15.11118503938804

 but the funny part is 	9.129756026185332

 —and reuben j martin cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life 	4.329228527805215

 a stifled sigh came from under mr power’s hand 	7.799929406483392

 like a hero 	62.42368334757024

 a silver florin 	47.20357426102979

 —isn’t it awfully good 	6.444131637457068

 mr bloom said eagerly 	10.859408265429309

 —one and eightpence too much mr dedalus said drily 	7.2327146736491095

 mr power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage 	9.14009667275464

 nelson’s pillar 	59.128326877775535

 —eight plums a penny eight for a penny —we had better look a little serious martin cunningham said 	5.17787406425775

 mr dedalus sighed 	30.962735165838154

 —ah then indeed he said poor little paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh 	5.839793838166368

 many a good one he told himself 	17.207405072965532

 —the lord forgive me mr power said wiping his wet eyes with his fingers 	4.397153490150762

 poor paddy i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that i’d be driving after him like this 	5.918392092376831

 he’s gone from us 	10.229461668014572

 —as decent a little man as ever wore a hat mr dedalus said 	4.697877871742259

 he went very suddenly 	14.134752241493635

 —he had a sudden death poor fellow he said 	6.1668300691255356

 —the best death mr bloom said 	8.264863917791088

 their wide open eyes looked at him 	6.8825213061580275

 —i can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays mr bloom said 	5.939069046496158

 all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats 	6.676968732594283

 wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast 	4.670955900637684

 —well there’s something in that mr dedalus granted 	17.46170106772987

 —and martin cunningham said we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road 	4.737175780377037

 liquor what 	209.41671971432194

 —many a good man’s fault mr dedalus said with a sigh 	12.0752800437797

 they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel 	14.71973546624509

 mr bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar 	5.136398576987344

 poor boy was he there when the father 	12.034904471403452

 both unconscious 	140.6878877950423

 all he might have done 	33.84399817096222

 the mutes bore the coffin into the chapel 	9.034400001992221

 which end is his head 	12.771379035271586

 after a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light 	10.026457997776111

 the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners 	3.8088985164675546

 always in front of us 	17.69692479989615

 corny kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel 	5.020183775486027

 the mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks 	7.73313489260653

 mr bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it 	2.8888042146019197

 he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously 	3.4706762252406604

 a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door 	6.671473194103158

 the whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly 	5.556640371134911

 who’ll read the book 	16.719556590725997

 i said the rook 	30.69803804511002

 they halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak 	11.731857620620403

 father coffey 	110.55980405580976

 my kneecap is hurting me 	7.265320243704539

 that’s better 	18.579040963275048

 the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin 	8.248367187911

 then he walked to the other end and shook it again 	10.680770782714655

 then he came back and put it back in the bucket 	11.343435478763393

 as you were before you rested 	23.760569684210587

 it’s all written down he has to do it 	6.7104381252748855

 i often thought it would be better to have boy servants 	7.654641293387618

 up to fifteen or so 	16.435211118060156

 tiresome kind of a job 	22.18118407313072

 but he has to say something 	22.100032013435758

 the priest closed his book and went off followed by the server 	7.536516415815308

 corny kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart 	5.759007197828062

 corny kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother in law 	6.993505555664833

 all followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air 	9.311345723779885

 mr bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket 	3.5911496121955544

 he gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left 	7.332786814808405

 the metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres 	3.810396133273317

 the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo 	3.4221604406511794

 mr power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone 	10.482089353338004

 —he’s at rest he said in the middle of his people old dan o’ 	6.406760757749126

 i’ll soon be stretched beside her 	5.066321767957725

 let him take me whenever he likes 	8.301371786927984

 breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk 	6.761292858602319

 mr power took his arm 	17.061100458229234

 —she’s better where she is he said kindly 	10.15144424184929

 —i suppose so mr dedalus said with a weak gasp 	9.32181193780336

 i suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven 	13.620253329427236

 corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by 	4.166263830978203

 —sad occasions mr kernan began politely 	6.5754998581200255

 mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head 	5.061585742181654

 —the others are putting on their hats mr kernan said 	6.061664884151232

 i suppose we can do so too 	12.509551946150602

 —the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly don’t you think 	4.812219958915415

 mr kernan said with reproof 	10.973077876064432

 mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes 	9.165628477382832

 secret eyes secretsearching 	31.039924200854312

 hope he’ll say something else 	12.35350338999795

 mr kernan added —the service of the irish church used in mount jerome is simpler more impressive i must say 	3.82984975638084

 mr bloom gave prudent assent 	10.507818762383534

 the language of course was another thing 	16.06676335305494

 mr kernan said with solemnity — i am the resurrection and the life  	6.409171163775918

 that touches a man’s inmost heart 	12.658086232256784

 —it does mr bloom said 	9.646197123925447

 corny kelleher fell into step at their side 	5.326876541223254

 —everything went off a1 he said 	5.21325014867205

 —as it should be mr kernan said 	9.916146532470135

 corny kelleher said 	17.662326173330403

 mr kernan assured him 	13.662479403278567

 —who is that chap behind with tom kernan 	7.252402612212495

 john henry menton asked 	14.452826458151327

 ned lambert glanced back 	16.1173045649217

 —bloom he said madame marion tweedy that was is i mean the soprano 	8.995337004700355

 i fell foul of him one evening i remember at bowls 	6.6734381174482715

 ned lambert smiled 	40.712073038453816

 —yes he was he said in wisdom hely’ <initial> a traveller for blottingpaper 	8.316933498028183

 —in god’s name john henry menton said what did she marry a coon like that for 	4.994662415148216

 —has still ned lambert said 	6.348490757009073

 john henry menton’s large eyes stared ahead 	6.110585611738891

 the barrow turned into a side lane 	12.206898227001142

 a portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage 	4.829462449747775

 the gravediggers touched their caps 	8.295650196893279

 —john o’connell mr power said pleased 	7.919670432602405

 he never forgets a friend 	11.288790916043382

 mr o’connell shook all their hands in silence 	7.088492185053985

 mr dedalus said —i am come to pay you another visit 	9.298679962942472

 —my dear simon the caretaker answered in a low voice 	5.338098017647042

 i don’t want your custom at all 	4.162125154073502

 saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back 	5.732854634692927

 —did you hear that one he asked them about mulcahy from the coombe 	6.837797241116203

 —i did not martin cunningham said 	8.768735870964868

 they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear 	2.613450664614157

 the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles 	5.400776223702236

 —they tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs 	5.81788127047729

 they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried 	6.731232752169955

 after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough 	6.501832844968536

 one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy 	11.278756914193993

 the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up 	5.071451120297598

 the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed 	10.464581990196411

 he resumed —and after blinking up at the sacred figure not a bloody bit like the man says he 	8.015219874841781

 that’s not mulcahy says he whoever done it  	5.321800782830253

 rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked 	3.63253075211007

 —that’s all done with a purpose martin cunningham explained to hynes 	7.132897428837311

 —i know hynes said 	9.538727651920208

 i know that 	23.77232850759927

 —to cheer a fellow up martin cunningham said 	4.5475154055789755

 it’s pure goodheartedness damn the thing else 	5.988716544803434

 mr bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk 	11.559166331183608

 —two corny kelleher said 	10.832550142423894

 half ten and eleven 	17.507204466168822

 the caretaker put the papers in his pocket 	9.961833040566972

 the barrow had ceased to trundle 	7.156128993626484

 the mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves 	5.83082531846612

 the gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it 	3.5013887941098734

 o poor robinson crusoe how could you possibly do so 	4.556667799298318

 poor dignam his last lie on the earth in his box 	10.783308661716232

 when you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood 	6.561602687866815

 all gnawed through 	29.108120053403677

 they could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way 	4.7859517160811915

 ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’ <initial> they’re so particular 	8.900774868068618

 lay me in my native earth 	16.97853941041564

 bit of clay from the holy land 	29.250566132839282

 only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin 	7.548039406899242

 i see what it means 	17.129780957585776

 i see 	33.24836805018286

 to protect him as long as possible even in the earth 	8.82123696315356

 the irishman’s house is his coffin 	10.857566974346025

 embalming in catacombs mummies the same idea 	9.519632211208863

 mr bloom stood far back his hat in his hand counting the bared heads 	5.950325851039734

 i’m thirteen 	15.3339228817215

 death’s number 	99.08719614631708

 where the deuce did he pop out of 	7.396157971396094

 silly superstition that about thirteen 	10.177717234126407

 nice soft tweed ned lambert has in that suit 	8.765177629779613

 tinge of purple 	35.26475749699104

 i had one like that when we lived in lombard street west 	8.428154749157905

 dressy fellow he was once 	38.460434489172876

 used to change three suits in the day 	15.192256604650826

 must get that grey suit of mine turned by mesias 	4.499195385568402

 his wife i forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him 	4.688897562315679

 the coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles 	8.552406141512163

 they struggled up and out and all uncovered 	20.48876326127204

 if we were all suddenly somebody else 	11.101061625319826

 far away a donkey brayed 	14.629468503913904

 no such ass 	41.34798174726554

 never see a dead one they say 	9.466564000289214

 shame of death 	29.459844279595302

 they hide 	159.31469668990795

 also poor papa went away 	14.358560984497979

 gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper 	7.6184108887875945

 the boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space 	5.609267611304773

 mr bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker 	6.704501584424924

 wellcut frockcoat 	209.41671971432194

 weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next 	8.731659384322763

 well it is a long rest 	29.78048238759889

 feel no more 	28.637542149747595

 it’s the moment you feel 	9.743674074434983

 must be damned unpleasant 	27.95857603411011

 can’t believe it at first 	10.496928197521708

 mistake must be someone else 	18.32547003669368

 wait i wanted to 	13.800950901671019

 then darkened deathchamber 	29.852133677274903

 light they want 	27.32123975266209

 whispering around you 	29.459844279595302

 would you like to see a priest 	11.452635328406869

 then rambling and wandering 	12.771194917989751

 the death struggle 	46.09003622406862

 press his lower eyelid 	15.037662522205636

 watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow 	6.979066257277414

 pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed 	8.552264200577563

 devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman 	9.765891267454592

 dying to embrace her in his shirt 	20.29366856001019

 shall i nevermore behold thee  	11.580437870102136

 bam he expires 	35.26475749699104

 gone at last 	28.6284267584821

 people talk about you a bit forget you 	13.863874326104932

 don’t forget to pray for him 	7.504577992311342

 remember him in your prayers 	36.37748260776225

 even parnell 	152.97741905529202

 ivy day dying out 	14.471237670438626

 then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other 	7.029834694864452

 we are praying now for the repose of his soul 	7.495176541990218

 hoping you’re well and not in hell 	13.558985068843842

 nice change of air 	21.62483710042043

 out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory 	11.811685732769131

 does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself 	12.908730353007964

 they say you do when you shiver in the sun 	10.127818849308868

 someone walking over it 	12.095666679031206

 callboy’s warning 	115.85775365947028

 mine over there towards finglas the plot i bought 	4.150640508777153

 mamma poor mamma and little rudy 	8.635431076972354

 the gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin 	5.153555152648032

 mr bloom turned away his face 	7.335424487681393

 and if he was alive all the time 	12.09830726740489

 whew by jingo that would be awful no no he is dead of course 	7.010900314284241

 of course he is dead 	16.96063097514006

 monday he died 	31.039924200854312

 they ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole 	5.163338527696511

 flag of distress 	44.43081028989707

 three days 	154.94271338462792

 rather long to keep them in summer 	11.500656232216564

 just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no 	8.360373535900122

 the clay fell softer 	16.461545356164766

 begin to be forgotten 	58.38802184863269

 out of sight out of mind 	26.809840328090335

 the caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat 	6.891245271880995

 had enough of it 	19.492620061731717

 the mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show 	3.3634113523955698

 mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves 	5.44113848840675

 quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields 	5.642183219121518

 hynes jotting down something in his notebook 	14.415382677046845

 ah the names 	23.190816899313937

 a seventh gravedigger came beside mr bloom to take up an idle spade 	4.97593568279556

 —o excuse me he stepped aside nimbly 	8.988039426047116

 clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole 	13.731090386662162

 it rose 	185.7629832400023

 nearly over 	159.89897151904876

 a mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades 	3.8557188771088007

 all uncovered again for a few instants 	12.914177082858275

 the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brother in law his on a lump 	4.5703090266900315

 the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow 	4.909247965058647

 one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass 	6.122436198655873

 one leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing 	2.975638017674126

 silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband 	8.562836218910567

 his navelcord 	152.52239858468985

 —right thanks hynes said moving off 	5.85574946007726

 mr bloom stood in his way 	15.347073994314083

 —if you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch he said pointing backward with his thumb 	5.481316465168924

 —did you 	11.971614407051117

 hynes asked 	146.3051524102258

 —mm mr bloom said 	9.743774181531824

 —thanks old man hynes said 	7.90649120535912

 i’ll tap him too 	6.880319536721951

 he hurried on eagerly towards the freeman’s journal  	8.094713935400694

 this ad you see 	16.64146395560015

 mr nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded 	4.681181696013789

 —he wants it in for july mr bloom said 	7.688297774309937

 the foreman moved his pencil towards it 	4.482968204426933

 —but wait mr bloom said 	6.156891448760084

 he wants it changed 	15.399350290563733

 keyes you see 	24.839045208842453

 he wants two keys at the top 	10.510690546822241

 hell of a racket they make 	15.120295896522187

 he doesn’t hear it 	8.288084920922957

 iron nerves 	183.0792258124879

 maybe he understands what <initial> the foreman turned round to hear patiently and lifting an elbow began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket 	4.877638261475251

 —like that mr bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top 	7.1380361124792575

 let him take that in first 	13.802319024730659

 mr bloom glancing sideways up from the cross he had made saw the foreman’s sallow face think he has a touch of jaundice and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper 	3.934862063125204

 clank it 	122.28297054636944

 o wrap up meat parcels various uses thousand and one things 	3.2779138026844934

 slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork 	7.52240968313638

 house of key e s —like that see 	6.86965026354742

 two crossed keys here 	12.126531058641527

 alexander keyes tea wine and spirit merchant 	5.469713281085533

 better not teach him his own business 	10.04347201891816

 —you know yourself councillor just what he wants 	6.6896051130798755

 then round the top in leaded the house of keys 	7.235598113118659

 you see 	57.27565444800398

 do you think that’s a good idea 	10.349290450806668

 the foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly 	3.7922161683791065

 —the idea mr bloom said is the house of keys 	8.867928770095382

 you know councillor the manx parliament 	6.565244669283682

 innuendo of home rule 	17.209298800581017

 tourists you know from the isle of man 	15.524397285688572

 i could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio 	4.828832649416309

 but then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him 	5.585034401639242

 better not 	53.57111687579114

 —we can do that the foreman said 	11.308451560703881

 have you the design 	15.151480597111778

 —i can get it mr bloom said 	7.521895136152863

 highclass licensed premises 	35.26475749699104

 longfelt want 	209.41671971432194

 so on 	92.803951351953

 the foreman thought for an instant 	6.731760201187867

 —we can do that he said 	8.263047974793404

 let him give us a three months’ renewal 	6.535023822235155

 a typesetter brought him a limp galleypage 	10.905335004904572

 mr bloom stood by hearing the loud throbs of cranks watching the silent typesetters at their cases 	3.8016348901249297

 orthographical want to be sure of his spelling 	20.605974767974093

 that door too sllt creaking asking to be shut 	6.711538059774514

 everything speaks in its own way 	10.867105090573924

 noted churchman an occasional contributor the foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly saying —wait 	3.4253128084538007

 where’s the archbishop’s letter 	14.952494847046808

 it’s to be repeated in the telegraph 	15.7486450146213

 where’s what’s his name 	10.576740425350033

 he looked about him round his loud unanswering machines 	7.038467271373182

 —monks sir 	27.296215840781514

 a voice asked from the castingbox 	12.398094068886326

 —monks mr bloom took up his cutting 	13.527017117325016

 queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time obituary notices pubs’ ads speeches divorce suits found drowned 	3.973495205871914

 nearing the end of his tether now 	15.504026077668833

 sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank i’d say 	12.928209523852255

 plain jane no damn nonsense 	8.595764106728339

 and it was the feast of the passover he stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type 	5.628357383431291

 reads it backwards first 	14.471237670438626

 quickly he does it 	17.313531446619308

 and then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher 	17.50098278809022

 and then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat 	5.841571829254198

 sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well 	8.017306065358586

 justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else 	6.303923261533701

 that’s what life is after all 	7.137839360125112

 mr bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing 	8.044019700582966

 now am i going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps 	10.773896035641958

 ned lambert it is 	16.1173045649217

 he entered softly 	27.4340362959405

 erin green gem of the silver sea —the ghost walks professor machugh murmured softly biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane 	6.185191438356343

 ned lambert seated on the table read on — or again note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles to the tumbling waters of neptune’s blue domain ’mid mossy banks fanned by gentlest zephyrs played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest  	3.392502792845741

 what about that simon 	19.382767596763458

 he asked over the fringe of his newspaper 	15.814091932332229

 how’s that for high 	15.937560963185499

 —changing his drink mr dedalus said 	5.232080493882039

 ned lambert laughing struck the newspaper on his knees repeating — the pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage  	6.1315668224964535

 o boys o boys —and xenophon looked upon marathon mr dedalus said looking again on the fireplace and to the window and marathon looked on the sea 	5.031580977674762

 —that will do professor machugh cried from the window 	6.595899318227512

 i don’t want to hear any more of the stuff 	10.031575366168633

 he ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and hungered made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand 	4.2231777348782185

 high falutin stuff 	27.31741161694852

 ned lambert is taking a day off i see 	5.666972556829207

 —what is it 	6.98408059776378

 mr bloom asked 	14.820510492604598

 —a recently discovered fragment of cicero professor machugh answered with pomp of tone 	3.4386735508035144

 our lovely land  	27.41604549210787

 short but to the point —whose land 	13.032192724912129

 mr bloom said simply 	10.859408265429309

 —most pertinent question the professor said between his chews 	5.392527331282552

 with an accent on the whose 	25.35977532100587

 —dan dawson’s land mr dedalus said 	8.06358539186206

 —is it his speech last night 	7.903388819796251

 mr bloom asked 	14.820510492604598

 ned lambert nodded 	40.712073038453816

 —but listen to this he said 	7.542425507790216

 —excuse me <initial> <initial> o’molloy said entering 	5.589277860584704

 mr bloom moved nimbly aside 	8.211836644513204

 —good day jack 	12.044061392472951

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy shook his head 	5.189496217122257

 sad cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be 	5.3590408124712265

 decline poor chap 	31.039924200854312

 that hectic flush spells finis for a man 	5.60546167423295

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy asked looking towards the inner door 	4.8153187038445715

 —very much so professor machugh said 	5.165850202516873

 he’s in his sanctum with lenehan 	9.76028018072668

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file 	6.142303428720704

 hot and cold in the same breath 	15.034578354970392

 wouldn’t know which to believe 	8.020284098707846

 hail fellow well met the next moment 	8.036858907234645

 —ah listen to this for god’ sake ned lambert pleaded 	6.7883782324451785

 or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks 	3.570456289018796

 —bombast the professor broke in testily 	9.2634618226995

 enough of the inflated windbag — peaks ned lambert went on towering high on high to bathe our souls as it were 	4.657195845251297

 —bathe his lips mr dedalus said 	7.037628940231481

 blessed and eternal god yes 	9.023154430843357

 is he taking anything for it 	10.22928379434534

 —as ’twere in the peerless panorama of ireland’s portfolio unmatched despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions for very beauty of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious irish twilight 	2.5144621193076966

 his native doric —the moon professor machugh said 	7.285115223637534

 he forgot hamlet 	49.476232570351065

 —that mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence 	3.3265345344398045

 —o mr dedalus cried giving vent to a hopeless groan 	5.953066442786287

 shite and onions that’ll do ned 	10.470565937883757

 life is too short 	29.055081039961998

 he took off his silk hat and blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache welshcombed his hair with raking fingers 	3.0778768014829665

 ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside chuckling with delight 	5.0161890296823985

 an instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor machugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face 	5.658125254703762

 —doughy daw he cried 	8.100796810646182

 what wetherup said all very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff 	3.213681302320748

 he was in the bakery line too wasn’t he 	6.608635164726331

 why they call him doughy daw 	10.655372271256507

 feathered his nest well anyhow 	8.480169657860364

 daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor 	9.25236408484159

 the inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face crested by a comb of feathery hair thrust itself in 	3.1382242504422715

 —and here comes the sham squire himself professor machugh said grandly 	3.358833202835155

 —getonouthat you bloody old pedagogue the editor said in recognition 	5.1836367040107065

 —come ned mr dedalus said putting on his hat 	6.498950599447257

 no drinks served before mass 	7.489422629358671

 —quite right too mr dedalus said going out 	5.771633270850611

 the tissues rustled up in the draught floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth 	6.718723053553307

 —sorry mr bloom said 	9.743774181531824

 he went to the door and holding it ajar paused 	6.665826992096391

 lenehan cried running to the window 	14.958447623041932

 a street cortège both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr bloom’s wake the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite a tail of white bowknots 	4.200271001882455

 —look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry lenehan said and you’ll kick 	6.639375549880359

 he walked jerkily into the office behind parting the vent of his jacket jingling his keys in his back pocket 	4.522087096514114

 they jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer 	6.693638140140791

 myles crawford said 	12.992657116680244

 he took a cigarette from the open case 	9.263988809645339

 lenehan lighting it for him with quick grace said —silence for my brandnew riddle — imperium romanum <initial> <initial> o’molloy said gently 	3.9384024082574247

 well yes bushe yes 	12.47117102915759

 he has a strain of it in his blood 	12.388794327670693

 kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe 	9.168156585045473

 —he would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for  	7.6086798501702875

 but no matter 	38.45059219447521

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly —one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe 	4.088996815669489

 it was in that case of fratricide the childs murder case 	6.207663381455698

 bushe defended him 	35.26475749699104

 and in the porches of mine ear did pour 	7.261753823458489

 by the way how did he find that out 	8.992564431196564

 he died in his sleep 	29.507885253629727

 or the other story beast with two backs 	8.336708820633518

 —what was that 	14.12760730007063

 the professor asked 	31.637479248491772

 italia magistra artium —he spoke on the law of evidence <initial> <initial> o’molloy said of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code the lex talionis  	4.236854349740327

 and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican 	7.6904707718785845

 —a few wellchosen words lenehan prefaced 	6.626722957605944

 silence pause 	183.0792258124879

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy took out his cigarettecase 	6.216532122944942

 false lull 	209.41671971432194

 something quite ordinary 	27.96540974684688

 messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar 	5.0921314601005605

 i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives 	3.0924192470434484

 a polished period <initial> <initial> o’molloy resumed moulding his words —he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live 	3.2234910839383666

 his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall 	6.344373017937633

 —fine myles crawford said at once 	7.647534496016272

 —the divine afflatus mr o’madden burke said 	4.123586713928569

 —you like it 	20.674135081563286

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy asked stephen 	5.545577837277108

 stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed 	3.3654669195079245

 he took a cigarette from the case 	10.941906792830236

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy offered his case to myles crawford 	3.5818426337757785

 lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy saying —muchibus thankibus 	3.786798638591027

 a man of high morale —professor magennis was speaking to me about you <initial> <initial> o’molloy said to stephen 	3.6511629887713197

 what do you think really of that hermetic crowd the opal hush poets <initial> <initial> the mastermystic 	4.148860063575039

 that blavatsky woman started it 	7.934730576492347

 <initial> <initial> has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness 	6.865593739365811

 magennis thinks you must have been pulling <initial> <initial> ’s leg 	12.773888536272612

 he is a man of the very highest morale magennis 	14.050290008419301

 speaking about me 	31.039924200854312

 what did he say 	11.083347721759617

 what did he say 	11.083347721759617

 what did he say about me 	6.263118629031713

 don’t ask 	16.28345245186171

 —no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside 	3.2077523804071992

 wait a moment 	18.018303567052158

 let me say one thing 	8.31104846055308

 mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue 	3.8310155355865483

 he turned towards myles crawford and said —you know gerald fitzgibbon 	7.716619167470147

 then you can imagine the style of his discourse 	13.503829121230595

 —he is sitting with tim healy <initial> <initial> o’molloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission 	3.984578813480969

 —he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a child’s frock 	10.659305104220575

 go on 	87.0143297603684

 —it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement 	4.430765847884061

 it was then a new movement 	18.702096357713728

 we were weak therefore worthless 	10.574459479320577

 he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus 	3.865237734511043

 impromptu in ferial tone he addressed <initial> <initial> o’molloy —taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed 	4.258636319368602

 that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall 	6.667302033584252

 his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it 	4.053176018654191

 he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man 	4.659856231943736

 his gaze turned at once but slowly from <initial> <initial> o’molloy’s towards stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground seeking 	5.861739496615956

 his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair 	3.6147378597505755

 still seeking he said —when fitzgibbon’s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply 	4.85124129576955

 briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these 	6.543406569780177

 he raised his head firmly 	23.311697901610053

 his eyes bethought themselves once more 	6.278395758567878

 witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet 	6.5388340218589285

 he began —mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend 	3.983439448212765

 his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech 	2.904585138370355

 and let our crooked smokes 	11.490073142283808

 noble words coming 	31.039924200854312

 look out 	101.76812185792788

 could you try your hand at it yourself 	11.473056937915086

 —and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride 	5.4194306015472975

 i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me 	5.706858017160692

 from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted 	3.8628238327973996

 ah curse you that’s saint augustine 	12.053732310332036

 —why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language 	3.58656881102202

 you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people 	5.295367901208381

 you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe 	2.651293452218491

 you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity 	3.4445071530097744

 —you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples majestic and mysterious are the abodes of isis and osiris of horus and ammon ra 	2.043195528504787

 yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas 	5.284972318274552

 israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her ar <title> vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name 	2.9997265682246197

 a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech 	3.7844091223648153

 he lifted his voice above it boldly —but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day 	3.3704635931009204

 he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw 	5.470676183741927

 he ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence 	5.4881612863863865

 ominous—for him <initial> <initial> o’molloy said not without regret —and yet he died without having entered the land of promise 	4.492416189965069

 —a—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously— expectorated—demise lenehan added 	2.012789193423889

 and with a great future behind him 	15.20744309804726

 the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase 	2.9378764788331657

 —that is oratory the professor said uncontradicted 	7.086134752324557

 the ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells floated under by the bridgepiers 	6.504181514737104

 a blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane 	6.606749064185322

 no tram in sight 	12.389689518422285

 wants to cross 	37.78805825873154

 —do you want to cross 	9.177882237347953

 mr bloom asked 	14.820510492604598

 the blind stripling did not answer 	12.46313608898485

 his wallface frowned weakly 	12.349995894116317

 he moved his head uncertainly 	22.125610508047426

 —you’re in dawson street mr bloom said 	4.2460241312371085

 molesworth street is opposite 	14.471237670438626

 do you want to cross 	12.147829440902347

 there’s nothing in the way 	16.93205096616646

 the cane moved out trembling to the left 	5.688803573317799

 mr bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before drago’ <initial> where i saw his brillantined hair just when i was 	3.8166400639888423

 horse drooping 	172.9342353939454

 south frederick street 	29.459844279595302

 —come mr bloom said 	9.470840403748126

 he touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward 	3.411074517217445

 say something to him 	21.646804881569874

 better not do the condescending 	14.050177818163721

 like a child’s hand his hand 	12.16790046284327

 like milly’s was 	26.935196382382927

 sizing me up i daresay from my hand 	8.003763386197928

 the blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again 	4.254114767935007

 mr bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed 	3.1945877492065953

 poor young fellow how on earth did he know that van was there 	4.617086737886283

 must have felt it 	24.177682005358502

 see things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume 	8.388106671664705

 weight or size of it something blacker than the dark 	6.354707306999979

 wonder would he feel it if something was removed 	8.207664353902585

 feel a gap 	59.41998250568854

 queer idea of dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones 	7.532819655560874

 could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane 	9.311540753206344

 bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest 	10.433710766138157

 penrose that was that chap’s name 	20.761807505324605

 look at all the things they can learn to do 	12.286249853946282

 read with their fingers 	30.607611973395255

 tune pianos 	209.41671971432194

 or we are surprised they have any brains 	12.108432125769065

 why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say 	4.502264137730992

 of course the other senses are more 	8.73053357288352

 dark men they call them 	11.504306481461697

 sense of smell must be stronger too 	12.590224787976545

 smells on all sides bunched together 	8.815725456067973

 each street different smell 	12.012977749024797

 each person too 	27.512764464507818

 then the spring the summer smells 	10.978460972628952

 they say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head 	7.0213275316754284

 also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure 	7.932855603389596

 and with a woman for instance 	26.229180628046134

 more shameless not seeing 	12.104646590208898

 that girl passing the stewart institution head in the air 	6.234996072939601

 look at me 	29.820444230440174

 i have them all on 	15.356701002516845

 must be strange not to see her 	10.089602321983655

 kind of a form in his mind’s eye 	17.49610124996294

 the voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves 	5.821798784090231

 his hands on her hair for instance 	13.66791687610277

 say it was black for instance 	20.52760534391614

 we call it black 	29.08204497551153

 then passing over her white skin 	9.623871918732963

 different feel perhaps 	29.459844279595302

 feeling of white 	44.43081028989707

 stationer’s just here too 	21.41304154559485

 think over it 	28.68433203688182

 with a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears 	4.243500105661866

 fibres of fine fine straw 	12.853533637237767

 then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek 	10.375285531622138

 downy hair there too 	17.209298800581017

 not smooth enough 	29.36833371064165

 the belly is the smoothest 	30.651817311179524

 there he goes into frederick street 	6.780015341510844

 might be settling my braces 	8.98681785446639

 walking by doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly 	4.827827562087205

 but i know it’s whitey yellow 	18.15105705459677

 want to try in the dark to see 	16.452388140692467

 he withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to 	6.286837011538222

 poor fellow quite a boy 	15.922286618820754

 really terrible 	159.89897151904876

 the quaker librarian came from the leavetakers 	10.865874725906991

 blushing his mask said —mr dedalus your views are most illuminating 	6.20277338038964

 he creaked to and fro tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine and covered by the noise of outgoing said low —is it your view then that she was not faithful to the poet 	4.368829352569184

 —certainly john eglinton mused of all great men he is the most enigmatic 	8.161056976846597

 we know nothing but that he lived and suffered 	8.802122442078788

 mr best pleaded 	39.35599181074174

 i mean a kind of private paper don’t you know of his private life 	7.22015058824715

 —as we or mother dana weave and unweave our bodies stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image 	2.2533745860705205

 and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth 	5.000713637053508

 in the intense instant of imagination when the mind shelley says is a fading coal that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be 	5.8458414041965865

 drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile 	6.569161539818684

 —yes mr best said youngly 	10.031391231081338

 i feel hamlet quite young 	8.632844174862187

 —his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience material and moral 	5.8222025547980785

 such an appeal will touch him 	9.095083174029156

 the images of other males of his blood will repel him 	6.7566794419394975

 he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself 	4.2072192907769885

 the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope 	7.11966311766257

 —i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public 	7.529309957540808

 and we ought to mention another irish commentator mr george bernard shaw 	4.65314478875493

 nor should we forget mr frank harris 	4.706244398344898

 his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant 	5.343032099142996

 oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets 	7.790003483359387

 the favoured rival is william herbert earl of pembroke 	3.930452226760447

 i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with—what shall i say 	4.424594969335021

—our notions of what ought not to have been 	6.376420673754494

 there’s a saying of goethe’s which mr magee likes to quote 	5.3677221040511816

 beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life 	8.857968908146384

 why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him 	3.5208110620264756

 he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet  	5.627634660902417

 belief in himself has been untimely killed 	8.830383896377592

 he was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield i should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down 	3.6598816619905556

 assumed dongiovannism will not save him 	9.444543245312467

 no later undoing will undo the first undoing 	7.748165883583475

 the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding 	5.031871501943672

 if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon 	5.409010138053589

 there is i feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself 	6.8011538543996055

 a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool 	7.626449978545246

 and in the porches of their ears i pour 	10.124741030329089

 —the soul has been before stricken mortally a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear 	5.898744713415374

 but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come 	4.663399808037647

 the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator 	3.843336536861289

 that is why the speech his lean unlovely english is always turned elsewhere backward 	2.9535900039901226

 ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to imogen’s breast bare with its mole cinquespotted 	5.316672207106085

 he goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore 	7.532717906109972

 but because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed 	4.148696680433049

 his beaver is up 	14.686702987537515

 he is a ghost a shadow now the wind by elsinore’s rocks or what you will the sea’s voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father 	7.061237495690206

 —yes indeed the quaker librarian said 	6.280967888320984

 a most instructive discussion 	16.220269346394357

 mr mulligan i’ll be bound has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare 	8.3166448994255

 all sides of life should be represented 	17.685838340801446

 he smiled on all sides equally 	10.953098186250877

 buck mulligan thought puzzled —shakespeare 	6.259328141116992

 i seem to know the name 	13.553331044658817

 a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features 	6.365336101112571

 —to be sure he said remembering brightly 	16.301113972836387

 the chap that writes like synge 	7.139289560871807

 was he here 	45.11126820079699

 —the bard’s fellowcountrymen john eglinton answered are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising 	4.025035201893626

 i hear that an actress played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin 	4.7065302685722274

 judge barton i believe is searching for some clues 	5.756940456787548

 he swears his highness not his lordship by saint patrick 	4.1952810575962936

 —the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde’s mr best said lifting his brilliant notebook 	7.49074701719575

 that portrait of mr <initial> <initial> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes a man all hues 	7.007852274851642

 —for willie hughes is it not 	9.150123087944214

 the quaker librarian asked 	9.498456692929212

 or hughie wills 	28.82785669362997

 mr william himself 	53.268065852790194

 <initial> <initial> who am i 	10.19528415218332

 —i mean for willie hughes mr best said amending his gloss easily 	3.4117957339062546

 of course it’s all paradox don’t you know hughes and hews and hues the colour but it’s so typical the way he works it out 	3.6481258811010213

 it’s the very essence of wilde don’t you know 	4.9953175436699695

 the light touch 	90.42151897098324

 his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled a blond ephebe 	5.631196760504369

 the quaker librarian was asking 	7.508973756469624

 the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious 	5.247921908617338

 they talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness 	10.052490562036304

 buck mulligan’s again heavy face eyed stephen awhile 	5.569628829393312

 then his head wagging he came near drew a folded telegram from his pocket 	5.597468863016275

 —telegram he said 	13.666574521116818

 ’twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar i’m thinking and he limp with leching 	3.773025857398247

 stephen laughed 	151.2204020978152

 quickly warningfully buck mulligan bent down 	11.926817233622938

 —the tramper synge is looking for you he said to murder you 	5.320917852108853

 he heard you pissed on his halldoor in glasthule 	6.217988559350098

 a laugh tripped over his lips 	10.657791581088118

 —longworth is awfully sick he said after what you wrote about that old hake gregory 	6.033113222457169

 in sweetly varying voices buck mulligan read his tablet everyman his own wife or a honeymoon in the hand a national immorality in three orgasms by ballocky mulligan 	4.125052145269726

 he turned a happy patch’s smirk to stephen saying —the disguise i fear is thin 	6.063759779614422

 a onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes 	3.0263363771650766

 he jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend john conmee <initial> <initial> father conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown 	4.842516144027404

 father conmee crossed to mountjoy square 	7.137130612733772

 he thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal wolsey’s words if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have abandoned me in my old days 	4.108732834096849

 he walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of mr david sheehy <initial> <initial> —very well indeed father 	4.215127558572901

 and you father 	44.359220990358104

 father conmee was wonderfully well indeed 	5.329610999869527

 he would go to buxton probably for the waters 	12.603588994540965

 and her boys were they getting on well at belvedere 	5.531920314047327

 was that so 	39.222579512734164

 and mr sheehy himself 	25.686505361069464

 still in london 	58.8583924260538

 the house was still sitting to be sure it was 	8.67849449577735

 beautiful weather it was delightful indeed 	14.782447162055563

 yes it was very probable that father bernard vaughan would come again to preach 	5.3270781496209665

 o yes a very great success 	11.280604656094733

 a wonderful man really 	17.031529859854246

 father conmee was very glad to see the wife of mr david sheehy <initial> <initial> iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to mr david sheehy <initial> <initial> yes he would certainly call 	5.898410398840663

 —good afternoon mrs sheehy 	9.02913694196994

 father conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun 	5.66744599926308

 and smiled yet again in going 	9.779642865177655

 he had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste 	6.596156908642051

 father conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on father bernard vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice 	4.548080570878988

 —pilate wy don’t you old back that owlin mob 	5.162100788017077

 a zealous man however 	12.043110257884106

 really he was 	29.459844279595302

 beyond a doubt 	37.25816559201531

 he loved ireland he said and he loved the irish 	11.811642434010418

 of good family too would one think it 	4.885446626264623

 welsh were they not 	26.934008186663057

 o lest he forget 	16.740219683284035

 that letter to father provincial 	17.275734148818238

 father conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of mountjoy square 	4.177444521255338

 yes they were from belvedere 	18.613050448185174

 the little house 	84.82249876985775

 and were they good boys at school 	7.083577346436513

 <initial> that was very good now 	32.29428425423771

 and what was his name 	19.449917546975726

 jack sohan 	153.1779396988694

 and his name 	58.966067240896656

 and the other little man 	17.44273902266546

 his name was brunny lynam 	10.843057935215594

 o that was a very nice name to have 	12.262032736437627

 father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street 	5.017572161075793

 —but mind you don’t post yourself into the box little man he said 	5.241702256049273

 the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed —o sir 	8.35037519466043

 —well let me see if you can post a letter father conmee said 	7.0914092432976155

 master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox 	7.1831434131538465

 father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east 	4.16926430144755

 mr denis j maginni professor of dancing &c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignam’s court 	2.649569960854018

 was that not mrs m’guinness 	8.580402236527167

 mrs m’guinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed 	5.240495347885058

 and father conmee smiled and saluted 	10.747064886287601

 how did she do 	18.171185337430902

 a fine carriage she had 	13.192941908724332

 like mary queen of scots something 	8.098249444454513

 and to think that she was a pawnbroker well now such <initial>  	8.249324021263421

 what should he say 	12.956118030851329

 such a queenly mien 	23.790191008383676

 father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left 	4.359518372039711

 the reverend <initial> <initial> greene <initial> <initial> will <initial> <initial> speak 	16.011060944357492

 the incumbent they called him 	9.618775083002758

 he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words 	9.915191199097602

 but one should be charitable 	18.983886066889156

 invincible ignorance 	209.41671971432194

 they acted according to their lights 	14.684462793016737

 father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road 	6.099099061720257

 it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare 	6.167631109192198

 surely there ought to be 	10.668344998344159

 a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street 	3.5255254087125616

 all raised untidy caps 	11.387946831993117

 father conmee greeted them more than once benignly 	5.64288168719138

 christian brother boys 	35.26475749699104

 father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked 	6.288921918303218

 saint joseph’s church portland row 	11.752569358466573

 for aged and virtuous females 	8.7668126315961

 father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament 	12.335558289340634

 virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered 	9.586731411340402

 near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman 	5.95189484644673

 and now it was an office or something 	11.411425193896834

 father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop 	6.365643501287955

 father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter 	2.209232621871498

 he passed grogan’s the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york 	3.840948574367451

 in america those things were continually happening 	5.438476064756562

 unfortunate people to die like that unprepared 	12.939536410607989

 still an act of perfect contrition 	8.63591067419729

 father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged 	6.106539423209784

 they saluted him and were saluted 	15.360909886617574

 father conmee passed <initial> <initial> o’neill’s funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay 	4.50989834149878

 a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable 	5.4399865490644075

 in youkstetter’s the porkbutcher’s father conmee observed pig’s puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes 	6.089094108583892

 moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him 	2.778902001511965

 it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people 	5.667432413086285

 on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee <initial> <initial> of saint francis xavier’s church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram 	4.107392763562846

 off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley <initial> <initial> of saint agatha’s church north william street on to newcomen bridge 	4.605325774642342

 at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island 	3.004725003291617

 father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse 	3.689669224674721

 passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket 	2.9584980005702812

 the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap 	7.588860940247588

 father conmee liked cheerful decorum 	8.04056864178305

 it was a peaceful day 	14.116727295864242

 the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down 	5.304268442329274

 his wife father conmee supposed 	25.581429550784186

 a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses 	10.640468779790002

 she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly 	2.7244088740238914

 father conmee perceived her perfume in the car 	9.617235997799085

 he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat 	8.428760591307014

 at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight 	6.127793060634417

 the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her 	4.3951446493992

 she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me 	5.08294178436216

 but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures 	4.527340618792191

 from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee 	2.7836486236435873

 father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver <initial> <initial> and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night 	5.14801206714474

 that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea 	3.9749207814272896

 those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not <initial> <initial> been brought 	6.266959683399662

 but they were god’s souls created by god 	9.852820838871045

 it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say 	4.043711226833426

 the malahide road was quiet 	7.546615641664753

 it pleased father conmee road and name 	9.854117677726029

 the joybells were ringing in gay malahide 	5.163859885710595

 lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining 	3.5649781557730975

 then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day 	6.361487998024758

 those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony 	3.6574939249501295

 father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere 	4.69259971091378

 a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged 	2.3275194226398352

 not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband’s brother 	3.3346935697661237

 she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did 	5.086094785057941

 only god knew and she and he her husband’s brother 	9.274347106208022

 father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for man’s race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways 	4.9579488300422545

 don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore 	5.745975654765571

 he was humane and honoured there 	7.416113613041104

 he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters 	2.9983159461796287

 and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee 	4.747598709067993

 it was a charming day 	17.546107586940593

 the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves 	5.320721712429452

 the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind 	4.340087659228823

 a just and homely word 	9.120427195518145

 father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey 	2.6989892753830165

 his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field 	4.844485378051533

 he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening 	6.804754307365662

 he was their rector his reign was mild 	4.900732867220007

 father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out 	4.843033858935133

 an ivory bookmark told him the page 	11.8709451926048

 he should have read that before lunch 	10.621152879848513

 but lady maxwell had come 	8.93185820140995

 father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast 	3.1078271687629337

 deus in adiutorium 	35.26475749699104

 he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ 	2.0752740345066596

 a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand 	4.944374380538181

 the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig 	3.2066220039115985

 father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary 	5.417369558815424

 sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum 	2.4001303193091146

 corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner 	4.568893015250159

 he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings 	3.6150663765354007

 —goodnight m’coy said abruptly 	6.125380282653228

 when you two begin 	22.256915537349958

 nosey flynn stooped towards the lever snuffling at it 	6.288694811310567

 —but how does it work here tommy 	5.459247766560094

 —he’s a hero he said simply 	9.67844817440011

 —i know m’coy said 	4.6561229363111325

 the drain you mean 	12.50806960258624

 it was down a manhole 	17.365930642276187

 they passed dan lowry’s musichall where marie kendall charming soubrette smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile 	4.207556334117499

 going down the path of sycamore street beside the empire musichall lenehan showed m’coy how the whole thing was 	4.2344461315013815

 one of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with sewer gas 	5.779087046782261

 down went tom rochford anyhow booky’s vest and all with the rope round him 	8.001110521391917

 and be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up 	8.844107971033273

 —the act of a hero he said 	8.450536350101268

 at the dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for jervis street 	3.2044562269811445

 what’s the time by your gold watch and chain 	6.907526722235705

 m’coy peered into marcus tertius moses’ sombre office then at o’neill’s clock 	4.5269422929090375

 —after three he said 	7.588213136215716

 who’s riding her 	20.425977450750175

 and a game filly she is 	8.430301860526296

 while he waited in temple bar m’coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter 	4.6736504802944285

 fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark 	4.175071800973099

 the gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade 	9.501127780903737

 —even money lenehan said returning 	9.54892496119319

 through here 	168.03975160094456

 they went up the steps and under merchants’ arch 	7.236023314804655

 a darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart 	7.79678606789319

 —there he is lenehan said 	9.778259150167319

 —wonder what he’s buying m’coy said glancing behind 	7.753315910673765

 — leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye lenehan said 	8.230220299861053

 —he’s dead nuts on sales m’coy said 	3.4886203422390034

 i was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob 	7.8970854901360745

 there were fine plates in it worth double the money the stars and the moon and comets with long tails 	4.531476130792145

 astronomy it was about 	49.702662966560254

 lenehan laughed 	136.72469761250227

 —i’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails he said 	3.6342032917338583

 come over in the sun 	26.58140550320792

 they crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the riverwall 	8.273760432582977

 master patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangan’s late fehrenbach’s carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks 	6.426253787487012

 —there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory lenehan said eagerly 	5.91006259975275

 the annual dinner you know 	8.668784973375198

 boiled shirt affair 	35.26475749699104

 the lord mayor was there val dillon it was and sir charles cameron and dan dawson spoke and there was music 	5.307529451688555

 —i know m’coy broke in 	5.803776047823414

 my missus sang there once 	7.704389360843381

 —did she 	21.590347561560726

 a card unfurnished apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number <number> eccles street 	4.590034332327889

 he checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh 	5.629175487330426

 —but wait till i tell you he said 	4.117429904967172

 delahunt of camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher 	3.3346033890039166

 lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice 	3.287508479778037

 after liquids came solids 	12.34431912184156

 cold joints galore and mince pies 	5.269303418550041

 —i know m’coy said 	4.6561229363111325

 the year the missus was there 	9.283403792352344

 lenehan linked his arm warmly 	11.931022843402241

 —but wait till i tell you he said 	4.117429904967172

 we had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before 	6.784464770595656

 coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the featherbed mountain 	11.620896968795185

 bloom and chris callinan were on one side of the car and i was with the wife on the other 	10.569111710712209

 we started singing glees and duets lo the early beam of morning  	2.657331744210801

 she was well primed with a good load of delahunt’s port under her bellyband 	7.425353799077308

 every jolt the bloody car gave i had her bumping up against me 	5.307233536452379

 hell’s delights she has a fine pair god bless her 	8.505691296832191

 like that 	38.725844088647776

 he held his caved hands a cubit from him frowning —i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time 	3.4599773239821916

 know what i mean 	19.146541767929214

 his hands moulded ample curves of air 	5.995034869894534

 he shut his eyes tight in delight his body shrinking and blew a sweet chirp from his lips 	3.9260123848584563

 —the lad stood to attention anyhow he said with a sigh 	6.66138944096658

 she’s a gamey mare and no mistake 	5.823870841713051

 but by god i was lost so to speak in the milky way 	10.705009374606725

 he knows them all faith 	12.81668886736293

 at last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away 	3.0753834393069295

 and what star is that poldy 	14.325295991872911

 says she 	183.97510793640953

 by god she had bloom cornered 	14.717847240135589

 that one is it 	17.36658970945998

 by god he wasn’t far wide of the mark 	11.615475806372523

 lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall panting with soft laughter 	5.170692270736872

 —i’m weak he gasped 	5.573025965530502

 m’coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave 	4.887582453337794

 lenehan walked on again 	15.862415981980948

 he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly 	3.537705453278115

 he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m’coy 	7.623651186169143

 —he’s a cultured allroundman bloom is he said seriously 	8.487428837696045

 he’s not one of your common or garden 	7.847136951779087

 you know 	28.580030833298547

 there’s a touch of the artist about old bloom 	8.894195677195768

 mr bloom turned over idly pages of the awful disclosures of maria monk then of aristotle’s masterpiece 	5.307305612453887

 crooked botched print 	29.459844279595302

 plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows 	3.465533590348789

 lots of them like that at this moment all over the world 	9.575324454107275

 all butting with their skulls to get out of it 	6.967953516145208

 child born every minute somewhere 	11.24042264743042

 mrs purefoy 	184.4949221825875

 he laid both books aside and glanced at the third tales of the ghetto by leopold von sacher masoch 	5.25122092712982

 —that i had he said pushing it by 	18.514053549282746

 —them are two good ones he said 	5.043447363982748

 onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth 	11.655312757332542

 he bent to make a bundle of the other books hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain 	4.760433139674559

 on o’connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of mr denis j maginni professor of dancing & <initial> mr bloom alone looked at the titles 	3.5361672879670234

 fair tyrants by james lovebirch 	13.968345077235922

 know the kind that is 	13.460769095318163

 had it 	155.1189336434216

 he opened it 	27.4340362959405

 thought so 	91.83214194932746

 a woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain 	8.722473668721554

 listen the man 	27.5054218996928

 no she wouldn’t like that much 	12.679947248196784

 got her it once 	17.868539218245957

 more in her line 	50.175092396154334

 let us see 	35.97929777451398

 he read where his finger opened 	11.478246311580689

 —all the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies 	4.248401286262319

 for him for raoul yes 	23.17481168481764

 — her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé 	5.685261992351655

 take this 	143.798616298429

 the end 	57.21836635779282

 —you are late he spoke hoarsely eying her with a suspicious glare 	6.02474092774059

 the beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint 	2.6324225878865035

 an imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly 	5.658407742724762

 mr bloom read again the beautiful woman 	8.467683852537972

 warmth showered gently over him cowing his flesh 	5.589704656001404

 flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes whites of eyes swooning up 	2.6424213161094516

 his nostrils arched themselves for prey 	7.556016077043117

 melting breast ointments for him for raoul  	10.146102227292928

 armpits’ oniony sweat 	14.471237670438626

 fishgluey slime her heaving embonpoint  	9.74115693607997

 phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop bulging out the dingy curtains 	8.187862787060382

 the shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face coughing 	6.894581610601948

 he raked his throat rudely puked phlegm on the floor 	4.913716786907765

 he put his boot on what he had spat wiping his sole along it and bent showing a rawskinned crown scantily haired 	3.47639119837073

 mr bloom beheld it 	15.908645999251382

 mastering his troubled breath he said —i’ll take this one 	6.846560492355295

 the shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum 	4.009313810037766

 — sweets of sin he said tapping on it 	8.35565810938486

 the lacquey by the door of dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet 	7.071029469976449

 dilly dedalus loitering by the curbstone heard the beats of the bell the cries of the auctioneer within 	9.481481610262646

 four and nine 	39.18751240253289

 those lovely curtains 	35.858051044916095

 any advance on five shillings 	8.35807455080505

 going for five shillings 	18.189308439745776

 the lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it —barang bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint 	3.6171377701391054

 <initial> <initial> jackson <initial> <initial> wylie <initial> munro and <initial> <initial> gahan their stretched necks wagging negotiated the curve by the college library 	5.020911148359811

 mr dedalus tugging a long moustache came round from williams’s row 	6.6334742477423365

 he halted near his daughter 	11.197242830552172

 —it’s time for you she said 	8.489974759903907

 —stand up straight for the love of the lord jesus mr dedalus said 	7.873051398957115

 are you trying to imitate your uncle john the cornetplayer head upon shoulder 	3.987600065585223

 melancholy god dilly shrugged her shoulders 	5.938413718914424

 mr dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back 	7.8311778666637775

 —stand up straight girl he said 	5.116081746530595

 you’ll get curvature of the spine 	12.990683368461795

 do you know what you look like 	9.573752760321595

 he let his head sink suddenly down and forward hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw 	4.121109101059475

 —give it up father dilly said 	8.143477137658225

 all the people are looking at you 	8.036845485459951

 mr dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache 	4.734136993987143

 —did you get any money 	8.388422777063115

 dilly asked 	149.07336339065603

 —where would i get money 	14.49249215794889

 mr dedalus said 	9.049626040409095

 there is no one in dublin would lend me fourpence 	7.777352095483707

 —you got some dilly said looking in his eyes 	6.150937685571616

 mr dedalus asked his tongue in his cheek 	9.027486520478904

 mr kernan pleased with the order he had booked walked boldly along james’s street 	5.149510191271756

 —i know you did dilly answered 	6.3976089756286765

 were you in the scotch house now 	15.233076584330256

 was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy 	8.949359653928225

 he handed her a shilling 	16.506489596681035

 —see if you can do anything with that he said 	8.612242268878076

 —i suppose you got five dilly said 	8.384294907710402

 give me more than that 	16.923405554461862

 —wait awhile mr dedalus said threateningly 	7.89905251471451

 you’re like the rest of them are you 	7.638042462180179

 an insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died 	3.705971163943306

 but wait awhile 	35.567500744209816

 wouldn’t care if i was stretched out stiff 	11.398375577119777

 he’s dead 	13.963562146303554

 the man upstairs is dead 	9.4835319099181

 he left her and walked on 	12.886527037885767

 dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat 	6.35194152520941

 —well what is it 	9.115137478214603

 he said stopping 	68.05694084556391

 the lacquey rang his bell behind their backs 	3.402555675453296

 —barang —curse your bloody blatant soul mr dedalus cried turning on him 	3.590326312865873

 the lacquey aware of comment shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly —bang mr dedalus stared at him 	3.2367768568414093

 —watch him he said 	11.003021599459615

 it’s instructive 	31.386642815035543

 i wonder will he allow us to talk 	8.62522624137033

 —you got more than that father dilly said 	6.64374876301375

 —i’m going to show you a little trick mr dedalus said 	5.395817850567236

 i got two shillings from jack power and i spent twopence for a shave for the funeral 	6.201768796207899

 he drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously 	5.353567183924869

 —can’t you look for some money somewhere 	10.187473288466244

 dilly said 	149.07336339065603

 mr dedalus thought and nodded 	12.116745630573705

 i looked all along the gutter in o’connell street 	5.421037061293675

 i’ll try this one now 	6.02847230762632

 —here mr dedalus said handing her two pennies 	5.959632088700803

 get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something 	9.32713805435178

 i’ll be home shortly 	6.280961558490762

 he put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on 	7.599907368941288

 the viceregal cavalcade passed greeted by obsequious policemen out of parkgate 	5.83717039987212

 —i’m sure you have another shilling dilly said 	4.933978229467583

 the lacquey banged loudly 	10.71317424984775

 mr dedalus amid the din walked off murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently —the little nuns nice little things o sure they wouldn’t do anything o sure they wouldn’t really is it little sister monica from the sundial towards james’s gate walked mr kernan pleased with the order he had booked for pulbrook robertson boldly along james’s street past shackleton’s offices 	3.729428932433804

 first rate sir 	31.480349415081985

 i was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in pimlico 	8.65225942646018

 how are things going 	9.856411482576435

 just keeping alive 	28.812643158609017

 lovely weather we’re having 	17.39248658570251

 i’ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin mr crimmins 	4.075608269868166

 a small gin sir 	21.416015004423844

 terrible terrible a thousand casualties 	10.70800929738803

 and heartrending scenes 	31.496332054233754

 men trampling down women and children 	5.51601247172467

 most brutal thing 	28.99281483832163

 what do they say was the cause 	16.50581079473984

 spontaneous combustion 	209.41671971432194

 most scandalous revelation 	36.52865771050584

 not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst 	5.730987298231332

 what i can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that 	4.545177813856954

 now you’re talking straight mr crimmins 	6.9965998968626355

 —i know mr dedalus said nodding 	6.88329515736276

 poor old bockedy ben he’s always doing a good turn for someone 	6.386193599624329

 hold hard he put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant 	5.737266195996886

 ben dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge 	3.191548843148165

 he came towards them at an amble scratching actively behind his coattails 	5.114484040220955

 as he came near mr dedalus greeted —hold that fellow with the bad trousers 	7.505738393974133

 —hold him now ben dollard said 	6.794450783206574

 mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben dollard’s figure 	5.354043334998153

 then turning to father cowley with a nod he muttered sneeringly —that’s a pretty garment isn’t it for a summer’s day 	6.272653180536922

 —why god eternally curse your soul ben dollard growled furiously i threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw 	3.030888245003726

 he stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff saying —they were made for a man in his health ben anyhow 	6.445243742924732

 —bad luck to the jewman that made them ben dollard said 	6.705401980551709

 cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell murmuring glassyeyed strode past the kildare street club 	3.0938518241439943

 ben dollard frowned and making suddenly a chanter’s mouth gave forth a deep note 	4.06761626282356

 —aw he said 	13.666574521116818

 —that’s the style mr dedalus said nodding to its drone 	4.530862782556475

 ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward his joyful fingers in the air 	3.9031826365460027

 —come along with me to the subsheriff’s office he said 	8.94068387401138

 —for a few days tell him father cowley said anxiously 	7.431789446681251

 ben dollard halted and stared his loud orifice open a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright 	3.2330215162093134

 —what few days 	13.641880543279534

 john wyse nolan lagging behind reading the list came after them quickly down cork hill 	3.1050594819620962

 on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti descending hailed alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending 	3.3724348861089974

 the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street 	4.045815807728188

 john wyse nolan fell back with mr power while martin cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past micky anderson’s watches 	4.131505992356387

 —the assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble john wyse nolan told mr power 	3.562361339307478

 they followed round the corner towards james kavanagh’s wineroo <title> the empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate 	4.053309977939499

 martin cunningham speaking always showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not glance 	3.4881820118851468

 —and long john fanning is here too john wyse nolan said as large as life 	3.7593986924777076

 —good day mr subsheriff martin cunningham said as all halted and greeted 	4.658582784003137

 long john fanning made no way for them 	4.792398022722346

 he removed his large henry clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces 	3.8464120140758378

 —are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations 	4.749942960745631

 he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk 	6.661686666211422

 hell open to christians they were having jimmy henry said pettishly about their damned irish language 	3.1584364195725727

 where was the marshal he wanted to know to keep order in the council chamber 	9.098126440220614

 and old barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma no mace on the table nothing in order no quorum even and hutchinson the lord mayor in llandudno and little lorcan sherlock doing locum tenens for him 	2.6867642866210004

 damned irish language language of our forefathers 	11.3649042380304

 martin cunningham spoke by turns twirling the peak of his beard to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff while john wyse nolan held his peace 	4.204762859775696

 —what dignam was that 	8.089084903296804

 long john fanning asked 	12.86868654023387

 —o my corns he said plaintively 	10.863039692234208

 all turned where they stood 	11.728892244544841

 john wyse nolan came down again 	9.659820057450714

 from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering 	4.614215168590112

 gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly 	3.5272902083590223

 in saddles of the leaders leaping leaders rode outriders 	7.951236803278606

 —what was it 	11.470657315165132

 —the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot 	4.707211402153607

 as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines —parnell’s brother 	4.777928708061282

 there in the corner 	51.972147999507634

 they chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard 	3.2941416081426023

 —is that he 	13.644077666006046

 haines asked twisting round in his seat 	9.38939379904453

 —yes mulligan said 	12.725472531889146

 that’s john howard his brother our city marshal 	6.3900334589894685

 john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested 	4.084859389494581

 an instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner 	3.522202144885823

 —two mélanges buck mulligan said 	6.1327019426335125

 and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well 	4.4816223247555875

 when she had gone he said laughing —we call it <initial> <initial> <initial> because they have damn bad cakes 	9.68923857791918

 o but you missed dedalus on hamlet 	5.772827435046879

 haines opened his newbought book 	9.31972475321344

 —i’m sorry he said 	5.921306692023618

 shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance 	6.892789058748628

 the onelegged sailor growled at the area of <number> nelson street — england expects  	5.7183956449518485

 buck mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter 	7.537146803822542

 —you should see him he said when his body loses its balance 	8.24018548479431

 wandering ængus i call him 	14.348053140099488

 —i am sure he has an idée fixe haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger 	3.5141029276548763

 now i am speculating what it would be likely to be 	7.740257241233654

 such persons always have 	12.684375973441355

 buck mulligan bent across the table gravely 	14.335415929932799

 —they drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell 	5.46260035315727

 he will never capture the attic note 	5.0544336197862165

 the note of swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth 	4.998691318315363

 buck mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come 	7.043785188906547

 he helped her to unload her tray 	7.805322084453785

 —he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth haines said amid the cheerful cups 	3.574232769856459

 the moral idea seems lacking the sense of destiny of retribution 	3.434815637830635

 rather strange he should have just that fixed idea 	6.579244451075396

 does he write anything for your movement 	9.14820837277247

 buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith 	3.0101464580625086

 he bit off a soft piece hungrily 	11.389885258391509

 —ten years he said chewing and laughing 	10.418836262450538

 he is going to write something in ten years 	7.6776813088882525

 —seems a long way off haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon 	4.725301373800095

 still i shouldn’t wonder if he did after all 	8.289049055778131

 he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup 	9.505255668668582

 —this is real irish cream i take it he said with forbearance 	5.838232680179542

 his eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun 	7.868183925561432

 with ratsteeth bared he muttered — coactus volui 	4.218557850928459

 he strode on for clare street grinding his fierce word 	3.825684792143476

 as he strode past mr bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards having buffeted a thewless body 	3.190933166779319

 the blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form 	4.673123409836687

 after wicklow lane the window of madame doyle courtdress milliner stopped him 	3.4774023066327304

 from the sidemirrors two mourning masters dignam gaped silently 	4.062309822166665

 one puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week man 	6.287639500975362

 but the best pucker for science was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him dodging and all 	2.7611559857316124

 in grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time 	6.828651084083193

 in inisfail the fair there lies a land the land of holy michan 	4.670993909556422

 there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar 	5.872411004689613

 there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept warriors and princes of high renown 	3.251784181400942

 a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters fishful streams where sport the gurnard the plaice the roach the halibut the gibbed haddock the grilse the dab the brill the flounder the pollock the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated 	1.9722448703110615

 in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage the wafty sycamore the lebanonian cedar the exalted planetree the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied 	3.101387549933564

 lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots silvery fishes crans of herrings drafts of eels codlings creels of fingerlings purple seagems and playful insects 	2.6253837631058077

 and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him 	11.205345423311286

 the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero 	3.3515296735907776

 from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus  	2.9233975247638457

 the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest 	2.942902608658582

 the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower 	9.266850753344544

 a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble 	3.514162415900047

 he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes 	3.467457115834544

 beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut 	3.8772043080166445

 his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast 	2.947922168284623

 from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity cuchulin conn of hundred battles niall of nine hostages brian of kincora the ardri malachi art macmurragh shane o’neill father john murphy owen roe patrick sarsfield red hugh o’donnell red jim macdermott soggarth eoghan o’growney michael dwyer francy higgins henry joy m’cracken goliath horace wheatley thomas conneff peg woffington the village blacksmith captain moonlight captain boycott dante alighieri christopher columbus <initial> fursa <initial> brendan marshal macmahon charlemagne theobald wolfe tone the mother of the maccabees the last of the mohicans the rose of castile the man for galway the man that broke the bank at monte carlo the man in the gap the woman who didn’t benjamin franklin napoleon bonaparte john <initial> sullivan cleopatra savourneen deelish julius caesar paracelsus sir thomas lipton william tell michelangelo hayes muhammad the bride of lammermoor peter the hermit peter the packer dark rosaleen patrick <initial> shakespeare brian confucius murtagh gutenberg patricio velasquez captain nemo tristan and isolde the first prince of wales thomas cook and son the bold soldier boy arrah na pogue dick turpin ludwig beethoven the colleen bawn waddler healy angus the culdee dolly mount sidney parade ben howth valentine greatrakes adam and eve arthur wellesley boss croker herodotus jack the giantkiller gautama buddha lady godiva the lily of killarney balor of the evil eye the queen of sheba acky nagle joe nagle alessandro volta jeremiah o’donovan rossa don philip o’sullivan beare 	1.7807067576423747

 a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone 	2.440724111843786

 so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid 	3.7584483102289954

 then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals 	3.6861996040592886

 but he the young chief of the o’bergan’s could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze 	3.880183224496956

 in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face 	3.5245161284194104

 communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus 	4.150724509060785

 questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels 	4.715854028980051

 in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them 	5.824837241065456

 interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā ālāvātār hātākāldā wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature 	3.2832397968926523

 asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power 	3.9799819297870966

 it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body 	5.234581899435179

 mind <initial> <initial> doesn’t pile it on 	13.916262634785294

 before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good 	5.831758389332277

 he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known 	3.9142315041716436

 he is gone from mortal haunts o’dignam sun of our morning 	6.1269398883543085

 —ah well says alf trying to pass it off 	7.687112942789394

 he’s over all his troubles 	12.782163919641027

 but bob doran shouts out of him 	8.88476259122182

 —he’s a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam 	4.5424660158568

 terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises 	6.643680802142185

 and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as you’re there 	4.503474283597283

 —the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character 	5.201978001691837

 the tear is bloody near your eye 	4.236096837717962

 talking through his bloody hat 	14.73426334361742

 —the noblest the truest says he 	4.583682546701864

 and he’s gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam 	6.194102061177259

 and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven 	5.1511877963488235

 old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door 	5.6639614281017305

 —come in come on he won’t eat you says the citizen 	5.477659368972947

 so bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there 	6.70303763100953

 —o christ m’keown says joe reading one of the letters 	7.7993182055471175

 listen to this will you 	16.90062747496441

 and he starts reading out one 	6.08326454770789

 7 hunter street liverpool 	170.28425929004484

 honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the <number> of febuary 1900 and i hanged 	3.8444253794687158

 —hold hard says joe i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain honoured sir my terms is five ginnees 	3.6336871418754257

 rumbold master barber 	28.6284267584821

 —and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen 	5.788128106659675

 —and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe 	11.56272320579661

 here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf 	12.80598469689232

 hello bloom says he what will you have 	8.396411693747904

 so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar 	5.942370005310105

 gob he’s a prudent member and no mistake 	6.141987625853598

 —give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe 	5.559600029327977

 and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it 	6.003211421679699

 —they’re all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses 	4.692898406763688

 and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull 	3.532587295599118

 in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor 	5.682790038080208

 their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord 	2.0738914453189765

 so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on 	4.387049667634046

 —there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on says alf 	4.797500105383287

 —the poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged says alf 	8.930716109150657

 —that so 	17.77238400305279

 —god’s truth says alf 	10.974242355279008

 i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible 	7.080103228250452

 he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker 	11.0682562193192

 —ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said 	4.379948200673755

 —that can be explained by science says bloom 	5.508121187071788

 it’s only a natural phenomenon don’t you see because on account of the 	4.406925771031775

 and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon 	5.650697178775311

 the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis 	3.1851289727701935

 so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other 	5.6319608699242325

 talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought 	7.9829804639376425

 mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs 	4.422111937213513

 and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get 	7.972086736213601

 so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him —give us the paw give the paw doggy good old doggy give the paw here give us the paw arrah bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip 	3.8161484464592332

 then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs’ tin he told terry to bring 	5.27668178893701

 gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more 	5.911924674035772

 near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel 	5.262668084318866

 and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land 	3.309032535591266

 and bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face 	7.55153310313294

 phenomenon the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley 	8.884200078148575

 time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk 	5.667573091180853

 and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didn’t near roast him it’s a queer story the old one bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel 	4.943297159331366

 jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat 	3.9605622889821346

 and bloom with his but don’t you see 	7.063326161111308

 and but on the other hand  	19.478734062634395

 and sure more be token the lout i’m told was in power’s after the blender’s round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment 	5.2840148860411755

 phenomenon —the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom 	6.884693891136711

 —ay ay says joe 	8.027090304435276

 —you don’t grasp my point says bloom 	5.038799229499533

 — sinn fein says the citizen 	6.875644372979478

 sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us 	3.319822730182936

 the last farewell was affecting in the extreme 	10.163048674166802

 from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance 	3.461798038538437

 the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle 	2.8084294172054936

 a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons 	4.514473098323179

 a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza’s plaintive muse 	3.17522168478589

 special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents 	3.4890869357045657

 considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l n h n and m ll g n who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirth provoking fashion 	2.647841059369414

 our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies 	2.9294672851935686

 the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat 	4.31116930790078

 the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite 	3.613984567287918

 the delegation present in full force consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbad hodenthaler countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi hiram <initial> bomboost count athanatos karamelopulos ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi señor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria hokopoko harakiri hi hung chang olaf kobberkeddelsen mynheer trik van trumps pan poleaxe paddyrisky goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch borus hupinkoff herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechli steuerli nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein 	1.6576859562560016

 all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness 	4.166702291342413

 an animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint 	4.647397927163208

 in the course of the argument cannonballs scimitars boomerangs blunderbusses stinkpots meatchoppers umbrellas catapults knuckledusters sandbags lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged 	2.486049076215075

 the baby policeman constable macfadden summoned by special courier from booterstown quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties 	2.4712881201558266

 the readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted 	6.866447535111148

 constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> several of whom were bleeding profusely 	4.719086310532047

 commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses 	4.3848727877490665

 the objects which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme 	3.075628764055874

 quietly unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the gladiolus cruentus  	3.2982389357846618

 he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried unsuccessfully to imitate—short painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man 	2.695229161382378

 the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries hoch banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable 	2.5336789802174398

 the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance dr pippi 	3.3145731103039693

 the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication 	3.2794300658890703

 hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously 	4.2566336893690435

 as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office 	2.742759420565192

 on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers messrs john round and sons sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim 	2.5602840278002645

 the housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution 	3.3827832131352586

 quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem 	3.345855808973236

 the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake 	3.675791432447028

 the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila my own  	3.301485688084367

 encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach 	4.148399168599591

 she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park 	5.104223089693043

 she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment 	4.767802367483049

 that monster audience simply rocked with delight 	4.390591064441808

 but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time 	4.829434277121259

 a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself 	3.1899185906131224

 big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage 	5.378474737091839

 a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot 	3.076973217847772

 every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in albion’s history placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds 	3.71666635744331

 nay even the stern provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion 	3.0019350249604946

 with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone —god blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart 	3.2244454275218106

 blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down limehouse way 	4.438500160162991

 so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland 	5.090227456570109

 antitreating is about the size of it 	13.10122146690291

 gob he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint 	6.229075191925864

 and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment don’t be talking 	3.6908013533828017

 ireland sober is ireland free 	7.276126508274338

 and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of 	5.044672676281909

 and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt 	3.4617266215330464

 so howandever as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me 	3.938125751036202

 i’d train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog 	8.119459239417617

 give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him 	4.832841389834531

 —afraid he’ll bite you 	14.989276005657599

 says the citizen jeering 	27.90879938563837

 —no says <initial> but he might take my leg for a lamppost 	11.151846436352082

 so he calls the old dog over 	12.052093716055229

 —what’s on you garry 	10.953217467701435

 says he 	52.47249435948582

 then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera 	6.216089452916536

 such growling you never heard as they let off between them 	6.562395069825465

 someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that 	5.915052769660241

 growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws 	8.764040002990916

 all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry 	3.153835931002455

 the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse 	3.1900135627769304

 our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient celtic bards 	2.177285511603237

 we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor <initial> <initial> <initial> points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye 	4.041784976948975

 we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication 	2.916324194562296

 the metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught 	3.0594841802733193

 perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour 	3.3355436712966036

 the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you barney kiernan has no sup of water to cool my courage and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights 	3.299531160374888

 so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off 	5.262673523555895

 and joe asked him would he have another 	9.005698865942794

 —i will says he a chara to show there’s no ill feeling 	7.292689084202456

 gob he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking 	13.374938897777536

 entertainment for man and beast 	17.19657958127739

 and says joe —could you make a hole in another pint 	6.920770732902928

 —could a swim duck 	12.237010928705685

 says <initial> —same again terry says joe 	4.945842677876168

 are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment 	7.7253196745872765

 says he 	52.47249435948582

 —thank you no says bloom 	9.993704558896

 as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham don’t you see about this insurance of poor dignam’ <initial> martin asked me to go to the house 	5.674885363673812

 you see he dignam i mean didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy 	7.448686799518271

 —holy wars says joe laughing that’s a good one if old shylock is landed 	4.02587792272331

 so the wife comes out top dog what 	7.131752120695464

 —well that’s a point says bloom for the wife’s admirers 	12.222428292315545

 —whose admirers 	32.922267181459546

 —the wife’s advisers i mean says bloom 	9.874132815141676

 then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act 	5.60246919471716

 he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court 	4.871002949218954

 selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery 	4.243067676675517

 true as you’re there 	16.56024529510737

 o commend me to an israelite royal and privileged hungarian robbery 	5.162421931563927

 so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her 	4.588706987866415

 choking with bloody foolery 	17.209298800581017

 and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that 	5.948700847887151

 shake hands brother 	32.48649680412545

 you’re a rogue and i’m another 	6.748519594546565

 —let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour 	3.6030687670756176

 but should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness 	4.602014936919224

 —then suffer me to take your hand said he 	7.135554619790211

 the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were i to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech 	2.815696268535061

 and off with him and out trying to walk straight 	13.246578044109507

 boosed at five o’clock 	9.950848880911238

 night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby 14a 	5.956125459764255

 blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups 	5.047465647754264

 and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls joseph manuo and talking against the catholic religion and he serving mass in adam and eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote the new testament and the old testament and hugging and smugging 	4.616377026807098

 and the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another 	5.138417472388016

 how is your testament 	26.36112685969434

 have you got an old testament 	15.626852981501752

 only paddy was passing there i tell you what 	5.0649278158921

 then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her no less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady 	6.8671865326446655

 jack mooney’s sister 	34.24053414156191

 and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples 	6.739531387512122

 gob jack made him toe the line 	6.501564018891366

 told him if he didn’t patch up the pot jesus he’d kick the shite out of him 	7.658464499751597

 so terry brought the three pints 	9.352593562997436

 here citizen 	154.82110338594853

 — slan leat says he 	8.100796810646182

 —fortune joe says <initial> good health citizen 	7.145570597411892

 —who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty alf 	7.006442604046245

 —friend of yours says alf 	10.020268133545905

 the mimber 	156.4518051831419

 —i won’t mention any names says alf 	4.6039812694252475

 —i thought so says joe 	8.848468997998927

 i saw him up at that meeting now with william field <initial> <initial> the cattle traders 	6.336090869756402

 —hairy iopas says the citizen that exploded volcano the darling of all countries and the idol of his own 	4.271304762598529

 so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue 	5.227061221525037

 because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard 	17.64049979243686

 walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier 	5.530832178602492

 mister knowall 	209.41671971432194

 teach your grandmother how to milk ducks 	8.330074680618957

 pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o’dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her 	4.503333403537429

 couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it 	3.3739761280340677

 what’s your programme today 	10.024084980409958

 humane methods 	172.9342353939454

 because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently 	4.9621803551946435

 gob he’d have a soft hand under a hen 	9.567928844171588

 ga ga gara 	31.039924200854312

 —nannan’s going too says joe 	10.626473701711765

 the league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding irish games in the park 	4.6965180106241515

 what do you think of that citizen 	12.952378384017656

 the sluagh na h eireann  	7.546615641664753

 mr cowe conacre multifarnham 	14.00145548048809

 arising out of the question of my honourable friend the member for shillelagh may i ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition 	3.0333715404715274

 mr allfours tamoshant 	34.00225722756646

 honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house 	7.473184373589043

 i feel i cannot usefully add anything to that 	4.689405248767118

 the answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative 	18.95103808955281

 mr orelli o’reilly montenotte 	14.41088514011634

 have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the phoenix park 	3.7658768344313986

 mr allfours the answer is in the negative 	13.217496414457713

 o o mr allfours i must have notice of that question 	11.288611644167743

 mr staylewit buncombe 	33.74666899954627

 —there’s the man says joe that made the gaelic sports revival 	6.19139601945096

 there he is sitting there 	10.923168261711595

 the man that got away james stephens 	4.965794145170598

 the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot 	4.756982937776099

 what was your best throw citizen 	9.793173523512406

 — na bacleis says the citizen letting on to be modest 	7.674606188987721

 there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow 	11.704675789725684

 —put it there citizen says joe 	8.624927726451862

 you were and a bloody sight better 	16.48533273712051

 —is that really a fact 	8.20410963017207

 says alf 	44.35609693685339

 —yes says bloom 	9.125447839861806

 that’s well known 	13.343589738045829

 did you not know that 	21.571605530255244

 so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that 	3.2530500159922893

 and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad 	6.62567876461797

 i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at bloom 	9.487110102589382

 do you see that straw 	15.081184398656934

 that’s a straw  	13.498444560518548

 declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady 	10.072469260791902

 a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian o’ciarnain’s in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na h eireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race 	3.4933654695337815

 the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions 	7.85462145219788

 after an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers 	3.8888373822887483

 <initial> bloom who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis’ evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself 	2.821443754974078

 the irish caruso garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it 	4.124936830674836

 his superb highclass vocalism which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions 	3.801910571308871

 the proceedings then terminated 	16.461545356164766

 god he gave him one last puck in the wind queensberry rules and all made him puke what he never ate 	8.098017719345801

 it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns 	2.7908308603183367

 the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions 	5.006826494162972

 the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose and myler came on looking groggy 	3.4460170883590684

 the soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennett’s jaw 	4.929241239720479

 the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook the body punch being a fine one 	5.05103244974964

 the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch 	2.737095136333379

 after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennett’s stomach flooring him flat 	3.851795380833174

 it was a knockout clean and clever 	7.315480794897139

 amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennett’s second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight 	3.556302731105534

 the ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality 	5.829941020004061

 an illuminated scroll of ancient irish vellum the work of irish artists was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket tastefully executed in the style of ancient celtic ornament a work which reflects every credit on the makers messrs jacob agus jacob 	4.602977154226264

 the departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of come back to erin followed immediately by rakóczsy’s march  	3.482545528607133

 amid cheers that rent the welkin responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant cambrian and caledonian hills the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while as it proceeded down the river escorted by a flotilla of barges the flags of the ballast office and custom house were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the pigeonhouse and the poolbeg light 	3.027921675991487

 the bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street 	5.533075466627954

 the catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect 	5.220360704096128

 the observatory of dunsink registered in all eleven shocks all of the fifth grade of mercalli’s scale and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534 the year of the rebellion of silken thomas 	3.982565485308216

 the epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the inn’s quay ward and parish of saint michan covering a surface of fortyone acres two roods and one square pole or perch 	3.211365458105039

 all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive 	4.36104806474925

 from the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character 	3.040251257339781

 <number> the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace 	4.9851378800988435

 far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and last but not least on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man mary star of the sea 	3.9523420039881945

 the three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly 	6.385278019525815

 many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name h 	3.737146014505039

 <initial> <initial> belleisle printed on both 	9.544019940113719

 for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them 	2.093299750794026

 they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long 	4.143890434427997

 and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight 	3.491277021388553

 he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words 	3.8714034606373886

 cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin 	7.008930963693732

 —now baby cissy caffrey said 	8.10606710741361

 say out big big 	14.644834893530962

 i want a drink of water 	12.340307429046797

 and baby prattled after her —a jink a jink a jawbo 	4.982673286765276

 cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on 	3.381899065023892

 what a persuasive power that girl had but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib 	4.260965808390205

 none of your spoilt beauties flora macflimsy sort was cissy caffrey 	3.496031673503474

 a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme 	4.920952324818301

 and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother 	6.362664450109626

 boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule 	4.9664383504382466

 the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had 	3.9994417256043544

 but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castle too 	3.1216126164998563

 needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends 	6.083516539531502

 —come here tommy his sister called imperatively 	6.158830212375976

 at once and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand 	7.66524341559808

 wait till i catch you for that 	6.891644388179641

 his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins 	4.065953726311114

 and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure 	11.381364124346186

 his little man o’ war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit 	4.631625851107985

 still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition 	3.9298851099829655

 —nasty bold jacky she cried 	5.71618728039521

 she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly —what’s your name 	5.216238664398292

 —tell us who is your sweetheart spoke edy boardman 	5.321470065169546

 is cissy your sweetheart 	13.672014721827207

 —nao tearful tommy said 	7.503702190097203

 —is edy boardman your sweetheart 	9.352061445173955

 cissy queried 	190.27975359405502

 —nao tommy said 	12.419224750584991

 —i know edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes 	3.567026655990929

 i know who is tommy’s sweetheart 	17.73193811312494

 gerty is tommy’s sweetheart 	16.370671498962416

 cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes 	5.940173926504223

 but who was gerty 	27.20769323708258

 gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see 	3.239177041343383

 she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell 	3.585429928705793

 her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling 	3.918609361372719

 the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid’s bow greekly perfect 	4.202255552179205

 her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either 	3.374855690137802

 bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again 	4.591411690242179

 honour where honour is due 	7.855112172478605

 there was an innate refinement a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep 	3.1761282699560267

 had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her 	3.450874826924437

 mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist 	3.5130839651960044

 gerty’s were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows 	5.081917251802625

 time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive 	5.8882352579948405

 then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose 	5.167248826547495

 that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one 	8.472592973420355

 but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair 	6.3927491163349135

 it was dark brown with a natural wave in it 	8.287825206194784

 she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth 	3.602055003480652

 and just now at edy’s words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal 	5.03376897037162

 for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes 	7.3674376908743575

 she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue 	5.434886500142644

 inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent 	8.786059490253555

 the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning 	5.7189161477834

 as per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window 	5.38135634073311

 only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother <initial> <initial> wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university 	6.970987171097371

 little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core 	4.079724258287276

 yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time 	7.896865300351231

 they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph 	7.051241763596626

 but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden 	6.112534449222467

 gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out 	5.529912274161244

 a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the lady’s pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection 	3.380947210817888

 all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny 	3.430942624439442

 her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep 	2.7526030732897064

 her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops 	2.6264190251209936

 as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her 	3.7234406438057297

 she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things 	2.7964275265736926

 and yet and yet that strained look on her face a gnawing sorrow is there all the time 	4.243358377556629

 her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror 	4.693748440956678

 you are lovely gerty it said 	6.564044277617994

 the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful 	3.7795679625815306

 gerty macdowell yearns in vain 	8.403987448720617

 yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie <initial> <initial> <initial> because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be 	3.9407083069974935

 he was too young to understand 	10.719750841077822

 he would not believe in love a woman’s birthright 	16.026896486788782

 the night of the party long ago in stoer’s he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips 	6.124486879358587

 impetuous fellow strength of character had never been reggy wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men 	5.021527961101226

 but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over 	5.754763371202489

 no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss 	3.5185331304107668

 for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve 	4.373996090581311

 with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward 	3.47403648673935

 and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be 	4.659625373821081

 then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november 	6.071824444208806

 she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess 	3.303404075557434

 edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight 	6.586851730386821

 but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please 	7.091613480620481

 the temper of him o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies 	8.47283144690846

 edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him 	10.8518654954716

 —you’re not my sister naughty tommy said 	3.9211502579275415

 it’s my ball 	13.584134134338775

 but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day 	4.669554920811008

 —anything for a quiet life laughed ciss 	11.42832816313756

 and she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor here’s his two horses here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin 	4.94246329975657

 but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him 	4.033033524874378

 —on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily 	11.226311509998897

 gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said 	3.7414503041751486

 but not a pin cared ciss 	24.2491650802343

 —let him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose 	9.414682122383157

 give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him 	10.806402374335251

 madcap ciss with her golliwog curls 	12.023097988882776

 you had to laugh at her sometimes 	14.652603220940739

 for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white 	4.916701923153351

 that was just like cissycu <title> o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette 	5.819682651319814

 there was none to come up to her for fun 	11.437298302398062

 but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome 	4.748992597572212

 and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ 	9.771795700897757

 it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes <initial> <initial> rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament 	5.832600847139449

 they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins 	3.6149192317331873

 how sad to poor gerty’s ears had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson’s weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none 	3.4372436867609326

 over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking 	5.000774577114299

 but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days 	2.567250483242285

 nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low 	5.69332095769308

 and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful 	4.5835063525639015

 and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk 	3.8149514133361313

 you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose 	6.407018052475837

 poor father with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke 	3.562584858613552

 her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken 	6.692966733991717

 no one would have thought the end was so near 	9.20796960124873

 now he was laid to rest 	18.983029327043837

 and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home 	5.371021044563512

 a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold 	4.650696270666008

 and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff 	3.1628186731962353

 everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways 	17.705143231874146

 it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window 	3.61146755180122

 you could see there was a story behind it 	12.020027244333885

 the colours were done something lovely 	6.048279589574996

 she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat 	9.08556699612102

 she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant 	4.224288662570515

 the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks 	3.4995330885994806

 needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball 	3.55621845031387

 our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please 	4.935420063816223

 the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock 	5.502196370163781

 the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed 	4.367538263337877

 —if you fail try again edy boardman said 	5.305013402327022

 gerty smiled assent and bit her lip 	4.226927889067462

 a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle 	4.0863870815492485

 pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking 	6.087883241963168

 she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks 	3.397883143849361

 till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen 	5.550166925069104

 through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose 	3.5915766606488813

 and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her 	3.494567015208575

 the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers 	2.72722425772449

 cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air 	3.187494503561499

 peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my word didn’t the little chap enjoy that and then she told him to say papa 	5.856411926166053

 —say papa baby 	11.941993562003251

 say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa 	3.6850369027953693

 and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said 	4.775587178959665

 —haja ja ja haja 	8.100796810646182

 cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him 	3.5218518738576834

 of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it —habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa 	2.7409504498060233

 and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks 	4.513632259494086

 it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased 	4.342653049899821

 gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins 	5.382783195186985

 she gazed out towards the distant sea 	12.35529686819415

 it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft 	6.869875786851857

 and while she gazed her heart went pitapat 	5.512167395962193

 yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look 	10.881994704090225

 his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul 	3.6778848704901383

 wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them 	5.619502379196909

 people were so queer 	23.900407046345414

 she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting 	4.867779413806532

 he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face 	5.974787654449328

 she would have given worlds to know what it was 	8.568821008531012

 it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else 	7.8845850093099905

 the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him 	9.066314211449244

 if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not 	3.2738658730169177

 even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her 	5.098908711326747

 there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm 	4.395702635051065

 she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past 	4.194804796516351

 then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone 	3.6484865493144136

 refuge of sinners 	35.26475749699104

 comfortress of the afflicted 	99.7432668380327

 ora pro nobis  	35.26475749699104

 well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart 	3.5462111347515144

 gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down 	5.758906210096056

 he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic 	4.754265060664093

 he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word 	6.089706985595236

 he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place 	4.595909876646944

 the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it 	4.369334606093247

 little monkeys common as ditchwater 	8.551320872983458

 someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them 	6.674846884543399

 and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned 	6.752922308954673

 —jacky tommy not they what a great notion they had so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out 	4.620669978237107

 she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible 	5.520441295701724

 it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble 	4.032815103767634

 tableau that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness 	9.521455324338497

 queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum  	4.788175884050183

 three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow’s of george’s street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself 	4.880359795924938

 cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature 	5.27070584409967

 gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness 	3.914088906650434

 you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that 	4.721672623175609

 she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve 	4.658890074579832

 she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes 	4.229124194782781

 he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey 	7.602187913258927

 her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose 	5.413243196550007

 edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby 	3.3158678270503765

 irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers 	5.784975477513251

 and she said to gerty —a penny for your thoughts 	10.956509367214156

 replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth 	9.042908543060102

 i was only wondering was it late 	10.164820514640915

 because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late 	5.275991878849913

 and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again 	4.473830595868105

 —wait said cissy i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum 	4.75821917212636

 passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself 	8.60608886469987

 one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure 	5.499590136729114

 cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set 	4.687353639519628

 his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones 	7.586376417863218

 cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order 	5.487238907006679

 then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time 	5.802672225433996

 it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets 	7.186754442389139

 she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon 	5.905379629681774

 his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine 	4.497296843256474

 if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face 	8.472085789706036

 it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it 	10.459377656798576

 gerty winced sharply 	28.888475509473547

 a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable 	4.580778306820889

 it hurt—o yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was 	4.021264220218057

 gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of 	2.7315720444927516

 she had loved him better than he knew 	6.907336533131213

 lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears 	6.390606362859801

 their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see 	4.247698318629743

 —o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up 	4.285135475724364

 i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year 	5.756677401651301

 her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily 	4.249785141040276

 as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces 	4.462361258617339

 and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot 	4.8218406052483935

 miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it 	4.105429759994528

 edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior 	5.8143236822624855

 and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib 	3.9755365723434357

 —o my puddeny pie protested ciss 	4.993216671450655

 he has his bib destroyed 	10.578236192859505

 the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights 	3.015810799560499

 gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands 	4.26960038452299

 how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry 	4.46251090029648

 and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of mabel vaughan and other tales 	3.3489065356933683

 for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of 	5.397820949622363

 she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean 	4.153530562724304

 art thou real my ideal 	7.83884868688576

 it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever 	3.3242416839218354

 and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it 	3.4923499432938803

 but it must end she felt 	12.805318100021326

 if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her 	5.949648562195665

 love laughs at locksmiths 	12.567193266436796

 she would make the great sacrifice 	20.728463294509304

 her every effort would be to share his thoughts 	7.083018665058098

 dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness 	6.686815865433009

 there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind 	5.8129460927911945

 but even if—what then 	18.709740598473527

 would it make a very great difference 	13.384070786474906

 from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled 	5.693788013412409

 she loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station 	4.354517345534356

 no no not that 	27.35207480506958

 they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess 	6.77936654156571

 perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall 	8.68336553465189

 she thought she understood 	25.855345905144976

 she would try to understand him because men were so different 	5.698201964279513

 the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes 	3.6810353036725343

 heart of mine she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide 	8.260281275277299

 nothing else mattered 	41.72723328436467

 come what might she would be wild untrammelled free 	7.274235735965339

 canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out —o look cissy and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple 	4.104324585069961

 —it’s fireworks cissy caffrey said 	9.012231310477363

 and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running 	6.026585360703158

 —come on gerty cissy called 	6.10314694035514

 it’s the bazaar fireworks 	11.594123190629958

 but gerty was adamant 	17.185323705690976

 she had no intention of being at their beck and call 	5.599099361259561

 if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was 	5.276050355107926

 the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling 	4.339228136209194

 she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her 	7.415923386848163

 whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his 	7.476753149986048

 at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips 	4.518704696653087

 his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her 	5.1584753825547605

 she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed 	4.6022008283539595

 but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips 	7.398447736219806

 besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did 	4.554302180890051

 and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark 	5.407140929093447

 and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking 	4.201547934112086

 she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl’s love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages 	4.76731362497433

 and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o and everyone cried o o in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent 	2.894845192547058

 ah she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl 	3.6532394603506306

 he was leaning back against the rock behind 	12.113244551666664

 leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes 	5.763148801385177

 what a brute he had been at it again 	8.890398527513941

 a fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered 	6.360166079951554

 an utter cad he had been he of all men but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered 	5.087393061221549

 should a girl tell 	28.735408924478794

 no a thousand times no 	10.71713221794228

 cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried —gerty gerty we’re going 	5.573577332076911

 come on 	35.00243683064441

 we can see from farther up 	17.297461654730625

 she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back 	4.618063703023804

 wonder if he’s too far to 	13.426778699329168

 she rose 	96.42475033843021

 was it goodbye 	59.385813312317616

 she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve 	6.085099320850337

 she drew herself up to her full height 	10.599907077024193

 their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face 	5.524528519081002

 she half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted 	3.4492706456641993

 slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman 	3.5943391073517192

 it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed 	5.655855008883768

 she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because gerty macdowell was 	5.211704200488319

 tight boots 	149.07336339065603

 she’s lame o mr bloom watched her as she limped away 	7.291630531897559

 poor girl that’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint 	9.481662483022122

 and kissed my hand when i gave her the extra two shillings 	7.423070664364578

 press the button and the bird will squeak 	10.45755875958016

 wish she hadn’t called me sir 	10.096331691920586

 o her mouth in the dark and you a married man with a single girl that’s what they enjoy 	10.162607809999027

 taking a man from another woman 	18.636565223987247

 or even hear of it 	10.386595121561404

 different with me 	29.459844279595302

 glad to get away from other chap’s wife 	14.08568802895182

 eating off his cold plate 	16.796726205286102

 chap in the burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle 	6.17422463976598

 french letter still in my pocketbook 	17.323395391538224

 cause of half the trouble 	21.68459258047451

 but might happen sometime i don’t think 	5.034302948418903

 come in all is prepared 	36.82551417799101

 i dreamt 	110.03945549829331

 worst is beginning 	29.459844279595302

 how they change the venue when it’s not what they like 	8.772958345280268

 ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who 	10.236060567208819

 or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped 	6.932161371789809

 yet if i went the whole hog say i want to something like that 	7.319261067987133

 because i did 	63.64518941961875

 she too 	165.1330093219267

 offend her 	172.9342353939454

 then make it up 	20.499311695348887

 pretend to want something awfully then cry off for her sake 	4.215858952375347

 flatters them 	209.41671971432194

 she must have been thinking of someone else all the time 	6.405705791697509

 what harm 	73.99859638014358

 must since she came to the use of reason he he and he 	9.200982821125432

 first kiss does the trick 	8.789926946420191

 the propitious moment 	29.034903414560628

 something inside them goes pop 	7.378578671882929

 mushy like tell by their eye on the sly 	8.055703245400924

 first thoughts are best 	13.290143128525871

 remember that till their dying day 	6.86045930282581

 molly lieutenant mulvey that kissed her under the moorish wall beside the gardens 	4.264874661995474

 fifteen she told me 	14.137657234506406

 but her breasts were developed 	9.253313574649306

 fell asleep then 	39.10785388779764

 after glencree dinner that was when we drove home 	9.806111336741592

 featherbed mountain 	209.41671971432194

 gnashing her teeth in sleep 	11.18965094824302

 lord mayor had his eye on her too 	20.876658510473657

 val dillon 	209.41671971432194

 there she is with them down there for the fireworks 	16.117593355114973

 my fireworks 	142.2777226715181

 up like a rocket down like a stick 	15.154866965555112

 and the children twins they must be waiting for something to happen 	8.144956163004272

 want to be grownups 	41.541002863162696

 dressing in mother’s clothes 	18.63623394453278

 time enough understand all the ways of the world 	8.49755484264808

 and the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth 	12.488436181336501

 i knew she could whistle 	30.353225240375075

 mouth made for that 	17.50302486422672

 like molly 	160.62259391939534

 why that highclass whore in jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose 	7.062146221291962

 would you mind please telling me the right time 	8.512789038196447

 i’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane 	6.874464029440057

 caressing the little boy too 	18.533820220477164

 onlookers see most of the game 	23.297559680624808

 of course they understand birds animals babies 	6.211480639958074

 in their line 	68.585874823741

 didn’t look back when she was going down the strand 	10.870516015281192

 those girls those girls those lovely seaside girls 	3.576769635891845

 fine eyes she had clear 	24.03419121212362

 it’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil 	7.507711353509627

 did she know what i 	12.472139298619851

 like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump 	11.491594913686086

 women never meet one like that wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of venus with all his belongings on show 	4.6478528453598615

 call that innocence 	48.014729802508505

 poor idiot his wife has her work cut out for her 	6.528089214644661

 never see them sit on a bench marked wet paint  	7.064506024907959

 eyes all over them 	31.740187423975307

 look under the bed for what’s not there 	16.79739091871122

 longing to get the fright of their lives 	10.610064091964547

 sharp as needles they are 	9.74115693607997

 when i said to molly the man at the corner of cuffe street was goodlooking thought she might like twigged at once he had a false arm 	5.6461256265612185

 had too 	155.1189336434216

 where do they get that 	17.12698815721656

 typist going up roger greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings 	6.458064743436558

 handed down from father to mother to daughter i mean 	5.5394605960811765

 bred in the bone 	59.782656025639646

 milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing 	6.988111984344863

 best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror 	8.793383822579932

 and when i sent her for molly’s paisley shawl to prescott’s by the way that ad i must carrying home the change in her stocking clever little minx 	5.713003158850581

 i never told her 	16.29776017402134

 neat way she carries parcels too 	6.253627258463494

 holding up her hand shaking it to let the blood flow back when it was red 	9.894900554354955

 who did you learn that from 	15.704057618009319

 something the nurse taught me 	12.128552191144346

 o don’t they know three years old she was in front of molly’s dressingtable just before we left lombard street west 	5.429343695257747

 me have a nice pace 	39.32424954746409

 who knows 	60.997126387004855

 ways of the world 	38.0498125759569

 young student 	69.7776809692393

 straight on her pins anyway not like the other 	11.518546550341853

 still she was game 	46.031425510700046

 lord i am wet 	48.4449947456263

 devil you are 	28.11469437105699

 swell of her calf 	47.835246549629716

 transparent stockings stretched to breaking point 	5.938413718914424

 not like that frump today 	16.900079259376685

 <initial> <initial> rumpled stockings 	20.848845412957413

 or the one in grafton street 	18.598496900765337

 wow beef to the heel 	23.199770369120646

 a monkey puzzle rocket burst spluttering in darting crackles 	3.0222354430144636

 zrads and zrads zrads zrads 	8.480169657860364

 will she 	93.99590142517515

 watch watch see looked round 	7.0956388806645245

 she smelt an onion 	12.850408916525835

 darling i saw your 	58.40665187597551

 i saw all 	54.247930006875336

 lord did me good all the same 	5.461452113705777

 off colour after kiernan’s dignam’ <initial> for this relief much thanks 	7.1852130707893584

 in hamlet that is 	17.046018295085158

 lord it was all things combined 	23.915835608910296

 when she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue 	6.513723993070475

 your head it simply swirls 	6.837601061232108

 he’s right 	13.335037213225695

 might have made a worse fool of myself however 	7.35344721838189

 instead of talking about nothing 	28.468287773091223

 then i will tell you all 	8.143635477146445

 still it was a kind of language between us 	13.053261387303587

 it couldn’t be 	15.327597181363537

 no gerty they called her 	11.837882523093851

 might be false name however like my name and the address dolphin’s barn a blind 	6.549182260497838

 her maiden name was jemina brown and she lived with her mother in irishtown 	7.4122429401077286

 place made me think of that i suppose 	16.59153027493269

 all tarred with the same brush 	33.566529626565064

 wiping pens in their stockings 	21.241615296942218

 but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood 	12.15409331490876

 every bullet has its billet 	8.231888936608717

 course i never could throw anything straight at school 	5.608335627976025

 crooked as a ram’s horn 	31.31527562681808

 sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah 	5.151677347576724

 no soft job 	28.669089316110806

 keeps them out of harm’s way 	16.944680651871572

 washing child washing corpse 	13.150446205127238

 cocoanut skulls monkeys not even closed at first sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds 	3.7195483744119304

 oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck 	6.360192725602052

 fill it up with wind 	29.00597247178743

 mrs beaufoy purefoy 	32.40830209162205

 must call to the hospital 	21.92988485782777

 wonder is nurse callan there still 	7.035242535252904

 she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace 	6.341414709812235

 that young doctor o’hare i noticed her brushing his coat 	5.717956237426241

 and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too marriageable 	11.246496092019763

 worst of all at night mrs duggan told me in the city ar <title> husband rolling in drunk stink of pub off him like a polecat 	4.883091308348088

 have that in your nose in the dark whiff of stale boose 	10.612793377903458

 then ask in the morning was i drunk last night 	7.217360321378545

 bad policy however to fault the husband 	4.222139854020579

 they stick by one another like glue 	9.07918708494885

 maybe the women’s fault also 	16.118136496958662

 that’s where molly can knock spots off them 	4.045965363031929

 it’s the blood of the south 	9.57765061061411

 also the form the figure 	17.185161055480474

 hands felt for the opulent 	15.386728899890791

 just compare for instance those others 	8.326546438844465

 wife locked up at home skeleton in the cupboard 	14.42176511277504

 allow me to introduce my 	18.4828788488101

 then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript wouldn’t know what to call her 	5.225739023359185

 always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife 	13.018453283714859

 still there’s destiny in it falling in love 	10.94702880115941

 have their own secrets between them 	11.119048239135742

 chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand 	8.329496127946424

 then little chits of girls height of a shilling in coppers with little hubbies 	4.508551458869248

 as god made them he matched them 	6.560463440260513

 twice nought makes one 	12.645116508717852

 or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride 	3.7416690207942835

 marry in may and repent in december 	4.8128114773140025

 this wet is very unpleasant 	10.50323234796045

 well the foreskin is not back 	10.485334364006404

 better detach 	146.47915476099774

 ow other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket 	10.812529967426382

 long and the short of it 	31.341628483582358

 big he and little she 	18.947470722537076

 wristwatches are always going wrong 	12.853533637237767

 wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he 	8.763056192560745

 yes i suppose at once 	18.277845863406675

 cat’s away the mice will play 	14.13913617821112

 i remember looking in pill lane 	7.89772541724303

 also that now is magnetism 	15.934454164037861

 back of everything magnetism 	23.768179184428647

 earth for instance pulling this and being pulled 	7.71108375052803

 that causes movement 	31.56605494607412

 and time well that’s the time the movement takes 	8.033124498187773

 then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit 	4.852560061592704

 because it’s all arranged 	23.31144200378671

 magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun the stars 	8.54704362963429

 little piece of steel iron 	17.08826334940805

 when you hold out the fork 	14.095062082452216

 woman and man that is 	17.190580629553914

 fork and steel 	44.43081028989707

 molly he 	151.53077610586848

 dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and like a sneeze coming legs look look and if you have any guts in you 	5.549197141930604

 have to let fly 	34.69732473738685

 wonder how is she feeling in that region 	9.339500324359433

 shame all put on before third person 	7.008585364829631

 more put out about a hole in her stocking 	11.609324619463814

 molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show 	5.01991692171741

 and when the painters were in lombard street west 	4.940086128202156

 fine voice that fellow had 	16.845540528766392

 smell that i did 	39.91857235753467

 like flowers 	160.62259391939534

 it was too 	25.039988576476013

 came from the turpentine probably in the paint 	18.872624775933254

 make their own use of everything 	15.723259431357205

 same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear 	4.892219375608644

 but lots of them can’t kick the beam i think 	7.180961284718083

 keep that thing up for hours 	13.454378365501295

 kind of a general all round over me and half down my back 	8.02913990298389

 that’s her perfume 	15.486621480494867

 why she waved her hand 	12.921169426645072

 i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow 	8.2707605454804

 what is it 	11.12747660206476

 roses i think 	35.26475749699104

 she’d like scent of that kind 	10.180154083509922

 why molly likes opoponax 	12.790951603714221

 suits her with a little jessamine mixed 	18.82241300892894

 her high notes and her low notes 	7.59191944969816

 at the dance night she met him dance of the hours 	9.079528791789626

 heat brought it out 	21.33872833612927

 she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before 	16.635256365529838

 good conductor is it 	11.936058649701533

 or bad 	154.78131487847884

 light too 	142.8073642452494

 suppose there’s some connection 	26.829119424051182

 for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark 	10.302727909089537

 mysterious thing too 	35.26475749699104

 took its time in coming like herself slow but sure 	3.1281554097274418

 suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across 	6.898070836008198

 yes it is 	17.056365793257477

 because those spice islands cinghalese this morning smell them leagues off 	3.3577263942798914

 tell you what it is 	20.271762169349675

 it’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you call it gossamer and they’re always spinning it out of them fine as anything like rainbow colours without knowing it 	4.082552127655169

 clings to everything she takes off 	7.765428969814958

 warm shoe 	172.9342353939454

 drawers little kick taking them off 	5.938413718914424

 byby till next time 	13.150446205127238

 also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed 	6.723570134688935

 know her smell in a thousand 	15.473630287511748

 bathwater too 	209.41671971432194

 reminds me of strawberries and cream 	8.972529555607435

 wonder where it is really 	32.66713454372624

 there or the armpits or under the neck 	13.145990306493031

 because you get it out of all holes and corners 	10.951245332767838

 hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something 	3.5418329822849723

 bag under their tails 	22.116326145756616

 one grain pour off odour for years 	4.245589663439703

 dogs at each other behind 	17.909408965922733

 good evening 	142.46949608911476

 how do you sniff 	23.087015426691973

 very well thank you 	14.290413201058945

 yes now look at it that way 	13.425486142483965

 we’re the same 	12.589395923856562

 some women instance warn you off when they have their period 	6.069657637723623

 come near 	164.76043261139642

 then get a hogo you could hang your hat on 	6.145384800156005

 like what 	160.62259391939534

 potted herrings gone stale or 	7.855112172478605

 boof please keep off the grass 	11.475732269236582

 what though 	167.8609944293509

 cigary gloves long john had on his desk the other day 	8.433088146890537

 what you eat and drink gives that 	6.6351504260260015

 mansmell i mean 	35.26475749699104

 must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different 	6.420573049715978

 women buzz round it like flies round treacle 	5.418239992238473

 railed off the altar get on to it at any cost 	15.516906543891071

 the tree of forbidden priest 	12.404763267649747

 o father will you 	15.12649604668441

 let me be the first to 	11.175638384674812

 for who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined 	2.6752932100677898

 the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed 	9.210492812186166

 she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth 	5.6119172581446035

 then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house 	6.505203514947357

 and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there 	8.091724253704507

 and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile 	6.0143296506715656

 also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility 	4.736917283042095

 but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle 	4.128924820682202

 and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery 	2.7428989773385566

 and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment 	4.626042642400885

 and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously 	4.056884258776496

 and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles 	6.731275926186177

 and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer 	3.2558584781152367

 and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so 	2.9404136690417433

 and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress 	5.488498937375908

 and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain 	4.6009306483034695

 and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead 	4.5763726605293265

 and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each 	2.4696933181392384

 and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile 	3.7812506312115435

 sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now 	5.089232884790389

 meseems it dureth overlong 	14.471237670438626

 and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently 	4.857709280242855

 but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long 	3.6968924362125195

 and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next 	5.350671792079088

 also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness 	5.726869115434812

 and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup 	3.6634340154193366

 woman’s woe with wonder pondering 	11.798961646015641

 now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might 	8.990851695901753

 there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable’s with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold 	3.403532384135628

 but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow 	6.544280380774108

 and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner 	4.756594757839636

 ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave 	3.8473607633256943

 for they were right witty scholars 	11.444804880773622

 and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case  	3.3503399449393942

 and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die 	4.077514550889654

 and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy 	3.702843082664438

 a redress god grant 	12.043110257884106

 this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die 	3.781953553689851

 in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack 	2.874990718425157

 then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved 	3.54647223973269

 to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk 	2.7472319682621222

 both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire 	3.4076714809858766

 but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of life 	3.7908945053038825

 for sirs he said our lust is brief 	7.0310779650554105

 we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we 	2.6029207865549813

 then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends 	3.460173122226697

 but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead 	6.105093723041497

 whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do 	3.1882373079449935

 thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever 	4.198858610842269

 then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides 	2.859691974906242

 he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded 	3.026975903440078

 all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life 	2.9797067861055906

 a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions 	3.2051205769676394

 that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word 	3.2871355590248257

 which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons 	7.981901114752266

 but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny 	3.4544698204400373

 and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores 	4.294791727221896

 about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray 	3.182350925277622

 now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment 	4.487603042619888

 leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone 	5.753229599862533

 see ye here 	29.241532443484537

 and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ 	5.394395869105601

 they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore 	4.462897022599919

 his words were then these as followeth know all men he said time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions 	6.045331170696312

 what means this 	30.42985346839905

 desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time 	4.895889234678533

 but here is the matter now 	21.8663356961732

 or she knew him that second i say and was but creature of her creature vergine madre figlia di tuo figlio or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with peter piscator who lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages parceque <initial> léo taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon ventre de dieu entweder transubstantiality oder consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality 	2.7469430671660637

 and all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word 	8.92021820368594

 let the lewd with faith and fervour worship 	6.215183168982588

 with will will we withstand withsay 	8.576009926277969

 hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch staboo stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack the first three months she was not well staboo when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard 	3.087255199265693

 it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him a murrain seize the dolt what a devil he would be at thou chuff thou puny thou got in peasestraw thou losel thou chitterling thou spawn of a rebel thou dykedropt thou abortion thou to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet margerain gentle advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred 	2.7877665902696824

 in horne’s house rest should reign 	8.992826401933193

 to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles goodly grinning asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days 	3.9683479216063207

 master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership 	4.061497981504803

 but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin 	6.176319445045717

 thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided 	2.9842281000523116

 he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their maid’s tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers to bed to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals 	4.444049704683578

 well met they were said master dixon joyed but harkee young sir better were they named beau mount and lecher for by my troth of such a mingling much might come 	2.2939686993626327

 young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it 	5.441210549267302

 came now the storm that hist his heart 	5.283920489979109

 and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry 	3.577048845466253

 and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm 	4.4184425873234465

 then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour 	4.304572326705007

 but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead 	5.59570462506314

 but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne’s hall 	4.205782008950478

 he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the braggart’s side spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon 	4.308810302508272

 no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away 	5.861274386436493

 and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other 	7.656035899842048

 he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either 	13.896453546233907

 but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal 	6.948397353755197

 indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle 	9.322906609652005

 heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon 	5.681100667165174

 why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done  	7.135209035960141

 for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show 	5.922134343242896

 and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away 	7.346794668848004

 by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law 	4.301806620730293

 then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe on me that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it 	3.736478836260121

 yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is bird in the hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two in the bush or by some learned carnal concupiscence 	5.365306109131744

 this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird in the hand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her 	4.098105602524634

 for regarding believe on me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first two in the bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild 	3.233239814618743

 her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag i hear 	3.9519153989502596

 in sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of malachi’s almanac and i hear that mr russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how 	3.7016868505930525

 with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk 	6.213073866667091

 he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat 	3.633699598506804

 to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies paul’s men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip 	3.662243709906677

 he took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides 	4.713452144872051

 the other costello that is hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale 	5.592012367002591

 but they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it 	5.360469631178431

 there’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset 	5.337545226984976

 mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too 	5.288970193915959

 from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes 	5.180432913036841

 one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge 	4.023014594042885

 he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him 	3.6644258572584993

 what says mr leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all 	7.17342577943793

 i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats says he 	6.253814114948973

 i can scarce believe ’tis so bad says he 	5.111833904677856

 and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street 	2.79061092697921

 i question with you there says he 	8.355281029102876

 more like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue 	5.391085710809548

 mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns 	4.5536250244466965

 come come says mr vincent plain dealing 	6.666776155346811

 he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s irish says he 	8.604527366924131

 irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop 	4.582358097528136

 i conceive you says mr dixon 	10.47594092242851

 it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose 	5.093333820920189

 he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains 	3.8135551060645825

 what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself 	3.8258688693278096

 so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly 	5.669446764195304

 but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland 	4.526438100665885

 another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content 	5.26544600846085

 by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture 	6.329297292174823

 to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him 	3.271094288562581

 ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground 	5.93525205917769

 and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry’s orders 	4.0107505819073745

 there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i’ll meddle in his matters says he 	5.921690619090642

 i’ll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me 	4.340873321695463

 but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show 	4.478091987448173

 after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name 	6.9002597892517255

 then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat 	4.3696410136054755

 in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt 	6.055929918765996

 they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america 	2.831244777754322

 which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty —pope peter’s but a pissabed 	7.3168943251508285

 a man’s a man for a’ that 	13.442797384141391

 our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars 	4.045167583412847

 mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on 	7.3271555843476115

 whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan 	3.586847133689181

 fertiliser and incubator 	35.26475749699104

 lambay island  	209.41671971432194

 well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon 	6.395740805872145

 i make no doubt it smacks of wenching 	5.512198600262108

 come be seated both 	15.264548415904585

 ’tis as cheap sitting as standing 	4.39756081316447

 mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired 	3.4411621694697443

 it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep 	2.809136656195167

 to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party 	2.046248875690952

 he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural 	3.49499746937648

 money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains 	8.826415032204123

 the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man 	2.8302137217198973

 for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies 	2.7688456463680713

 after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it 	4.265569330556227

 they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald 	5.323806697598795

 his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle 	3.4140640202430754

 mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck 	2.2438030658298436

 valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced 	4.420086832433323

 the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour 	4.215680818227515

 mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give 	3.3871665072846695

 who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of horne’s house that was in an interesting condition poor body from woman’s woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place 	3.157865471954397

 mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach 	3.7751531231218283

 for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop there’s a belly that never bore a bastard 	3.292341828886781

 this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight 	3.8479227410088406

 the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber 	5.689534185296552

 here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it 	3.916290465547658

 mais bien sûr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments  	3.5637239493421506

 that you may and very opportunely 	23.462058942056952

 there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity 	4.47992371450637

 but gracious heaven was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my god i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things 	5.241584208978661

 with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein 	3.409911849817967

 gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness ’pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever 	2.680056250102919

 i declare i was never so touched in all my life 	7.164550107127979

 god i thank thee as the author of my days thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours 	3.068425463597563

 a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again 	3.4210683187017183

 but indeed sir i wander from the point 	9.561727237824838

 how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys 	4.990754765985472

 maledicity he exclaimed in anguish 	9.74115693607997

 would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along i could weep to think of it 	4.493911974558001

 then though it had poured seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse 	5.649165946280781

 but beshrew me he cried clapping hand to his forehead tomorrow will be a new day and thousand thunders i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting 	4.025492245753768

 tut tut cries le fécondateur tripping in my friend monsieur moore that most accomplished traveller i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any even the stoutest cloak 	3.3707676411556795

 a drenching of that violence he tells me sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world 	2.684241349787407

 pooh a livre cries monsieur lynch 	6.665644026641167

 the clumsy things are dear at a sou 	6.338270816752448

 one umbrella were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom is worth ten such stopgaps 	2.6618841907907362

 no woman of any wit would wear one 	7.947847859084131

 my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment 	3.0940792389892646

 the first said she and here my pretty philosopher as i handed her to her tilbury to fix my attention gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear the first is a bath 	4.381464347044876

 but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge 	4.0590896186686765

 amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company 	4.451569146246068

 the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry 	3.462303807747132

 strike me silly said costello a low fellow who was fuddled 	4.9661852538028946

 a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh i’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you 	4.655044684866854

 what you dog 	52.1152877998763

 have you a way with them 	15.112932303735803

 gad’s bud immensely so said mr lynch 	9.642632177641344

 the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice 	13.01607294824156

 demme does not doctor o’gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin 	5.685734915193513

 lawksamercy doctor cried the young blood in the primrose vest feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body how you do tease a body drat the man bless me i’m all of a wibbly wobbly 	4.520895705122107

 why you’re as bad as dear little father cantekissem that you are may this pot of four half choke me cried costello if she aint in the family way 	3.9160828881373035

 i knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her 	6.686768530352055

 the young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward 	5.1464256307535425

 merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy 	7.330837192082282

 i want patience said he with those who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct revile an ennobling profession which saving the reverence due to the deity is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth 	3.1344405856195365

 i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which so far from being a byword should be a glorious incentive in the human breast 	5.3309647216961755

 i cannot away with them 	12.479792798321117

 malign such an one the amiable miss callan who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours 	5.742382124658225

 and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay 	5.340426492567807

 perish the thought i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne 	3.9936283542533313

 having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door 	5.231680048785108

 a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath 	3.021411208119557

 stap my vitals said he them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart 	4.323507305094089

 to revert to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity 	4.241231646242806

 the young sparks it is true were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf 	2.4652093670822026

 but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin 	4.7390871468856695

 it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and by intercepting them with the readiest precaution foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable 	3.2414164567658332

 to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that having lost all forbearance can lose no more there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat 	2.686523605856822

 not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe is ever as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions 	4.09510089178457

 to conclude while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was however it must be owned not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being 	5.846417198913799

 accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his notion of the thing his opinion who ought not perchance to express one was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers 	4.768596557490015

 the dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron 	4.957138730739228

 i must acquaint you said mr crotthers clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis old glory allelujurum was round again today an elderly man with dundrearies preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina my life as he calls her 	3.0148533484525095

 i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her 	3.474099778304214

 all fell to praising of it each after his own fashion though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household 	3.088941009643649

 singular communed the guest with himself the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest 	2.540106387978014

 where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled 	5.706787954478398

 during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents 	3.8005629000064953

 has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received 	4.436901295643525

 or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is if report belie him not his own and his only enjoyer 	5.733526830230702

 far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady the daughter of a gallant major or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done then be it so 	3.9498437948572205

 he says this a censor of morals a very pelican in his piety who did not scruple oblivious of the ties of nature to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society nay had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with hagar the egyptian in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic 	3.7229984598775134

 the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which when rooted in its native orient throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but transplanted to a clime more temperate its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant acid and inoperative 	2.2734959410046467

 the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born 	4.842428081629123

 when he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier broke out at once into a strife of tongues 	3.8075091876967995

 in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge to mollify to refrain 	3.6182678877840675

 the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent 	4.122973727392593

 every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers the caesarean section posthumity with respect to the father and that rarer form with respect to the mother the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets miscarriages and infanticides simulated or dissimulated the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen cited by mr candidate mulligan in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that as he said one ear could hear what the other spoke the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid as exemplified in the actual case with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix artificial insemination by means of syringes involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers sturzgeburt the recorded instances of multiseminal twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations 	2.7137520193858786

 the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest by her movement the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning ardently and ineffectually entertained to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation 	3.435409437343814

 the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived 	6.15069923945446

 it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man 	3.2388114999583686

 contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus 	2.20214414923208

 an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven 	4.884025137013976

 he was gone 	38.42281390810006

 but hey presto the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes shrivels dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist 	4.677858707495279

 now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons 	6.72480982310428

 there is none now to be for leopold what leopold was for rudolph 	5.0302848317127316

 the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence silence that is the infinite of space and swiftly silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived 	2.3763712381604067

 how serene does she now arise a queen among the pleiades in the penultimate antelucan hour shod in sandals of bright gold coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer 	3.4661746759585563

 it floats it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams emerald sapphire mauve and heliotrope sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind winding coiling simply swirling writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol it blazes alpha a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus 	2.2935691583912443

 francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee’s time 	5.687784843414623

 he asked about glaucon alcibiades pisistratus 	4.921573349358695

 where were they now 	28.616220333885256

 neither knew 	172.9342353939454

 you have spoken of the past and its phantoms stephen said 	7.323810257768238

 why think of them 	26.22822363181095

 if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call 	5.82713282583004

 who supposes it 	30.299560800919316

 i bous stephanoumenos bullockbefriending bard am lord and giver of their life 	4.045863418627796

 he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves smiling at vincent 	3.887775900363546

 that answer and those leaves vincent said to him will adorn you more fitly when something more and greatly more than a capful of light odes can call your genius father 	2.7460867374017863

 all who wish you well hope this for you 	4.378864673787229

 all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate to acclaim you stephaneforos 	4.273936599608527

 o no vincent lenehan said laying a hand on the shoulder near him 	6.5098373753482255

 have no fear 	70.04024645789457

 he could not leave his mother an orphan 	10.247168521538862

 the young man’s face grew dark 	8.412133890049024

 all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss 	9.435420411597756

 he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart 	7.061697267123392

 madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name lenehan as much more 	6.169124343925068

 he told them of the race 	22.12946411064525

 she was leading the field 	10.185604747594372

 all hearts were beating 	14.902808368623214

 even phyllis could not contain herself 	9.960618596216031

 she waved her scarf and cried huzzah sceptre wins but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level reached outstripped her 	3.293549947648868

 phyllis was silent her eyes were sad anemones 	8.047082320579094

 juno she cried i am undone 	18.469574498551804

 but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook 	4.130342436006234

 a tear fell one only 	10.783838278771473

 a whacking fine whip said lenehan is <initial> lane 	3.264194823453275

 four winners yesterday and three today 	7.651037055773955

 what rider is like him 	11.433056585967538

 mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his 	5.183051701998578

 but let us bear it as was the ancient wont 	11.34467649264935

 mercy on the luckless poor sceptre he said with a light sigh 	13.394234888871683

 she is not the filly that she was 	7.107027364108462

 by gad sir a queen of them 	7.030242174007351

 do you remember her vincent 	10.748366466069344

 i wish you could have seen my queen today vincent said 	6.155435230037487

 how young she was and radiant lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it 	4.091381878413791

 the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us 	4.041230483235171

 in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge 	3.6330854751913573

 but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close 	8.298822155303252

 she is more taking then 	10.143756492709024

 her posies too mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together 	4.304025223071335

 and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field 	5.322867620017657

 conmee himself he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page 	4.564320627427732

 the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her 	3.4880998352646126

 when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries 	4.241262470837905

 but he had been kind 	21.916556503893133

 in going by he had blessed us 	13.9422685540226

 the gods too are ever kind lenehan said 	4.71623182568593

 if i had poor luck with bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely 	4.533468872465839

 he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label 	5.326476785990602

 warily malachi whispered preserve a druid silence 	4.604114342494332

 his soul is far away 	16.166060876987704

 it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born 	7.826356109904889

 any object intensely regarded may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods 	6.685077078291526

 do you not think it stephen 	13.15625022816749

 theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law 	4.393951042946733

 the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation 	4.180434338935982

 however as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all 	4.977518347339182

 the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop 	2.9362297764211593

 during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton on trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance 	3.573006970031495

 he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn 	3.7984605489341265

 eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place 	5.059065445832237

 the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life 	5.272661377139981

 neither place nor council was lacking in dignity 	3.6263543959639737

 the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital 	7.564462133211298

 the high hall of horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic 	4.07852051778362

 a gallant scene in truth it made 	5.579275477085552

 crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway 	6.9796936662100615

 next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden 	3.3548664866708524

 the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan 	2.948577413466508

 lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come 	2.6011495220079808

 it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr <initial> dedalus’ div 	6.022490479100219

 contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods 	2.4221347067332464

 the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can 	3.54538735181179

 there may be it is true some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by mr <initial> bloom pubb 	3.968949158823233

 regarding the future determination of sex 	8.985329172266871

 must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both 	2.2958956586608616

 this would be tantamount to a cooperation one of nature’s favourite devices between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position succubitus felix of the passive element 	7.0896826420675625

 the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality 	5.330937484867479

 it is interesting because as he pertinently remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways 	5.2502312587816995

 mr <initial> mulligan hyg 	16.664144934982335

 et eug 	149.07336339065603

 blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids pulmonary complaints etc 	2.8696233422796236

 by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust 	3.561370356178451

 these factors he alleged and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets hideous publicity posters religious ministers of all denominations mutilated soldiers and sailors exposed scorbutic cardrivers the suspended carcases of dead animals paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these he said were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race 	2.4175033551742158

 kalipedia he prophesied would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life genuinely good music agreeable literature light philosophy instructive pictures plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo artistic coloured photographs of prize babies all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner 	2.6875907712133222

 mr <initial> crotthers disc 	16.664144934982335

 attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide 	3.146798953512262

 although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative 	3.7091895907694017

 in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions 	3.959629307164291

 an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr <initial> lynch bacc 	5.932595533145604

 that both natality and mortality as well as all other phenomena of evolution tidal movements lunar phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in fine in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained 	3.0763943344287763

 still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poet’s words give us pause 	2.995323543308065

 nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest 	2.8117510102832517

 mr <initial> dedalus’ div 	10.112906458351723

 remark or should it be called an interruption 	6.1049824905425325

 that an omnivorous being which can masticate deglute digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition corpulent professional gentlemen not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to 	1.951122626639298

 for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother 	2.758629702868316

 in a recent public controversy with mr <initial> bloom pubb 	6.3353210462886445

 sir to you my hand 	21.956400678098646

 well done thou good and faithful servant there are sins or let us call them as the world calls them evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait 	4.459361505806767

 he may suffer their memory to grow dim let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise 	4.659770739012926

 yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances a vision or a dream or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with wine 	3.9361630601557813

 not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past silent remote reproachful 	4.147688071413006

 the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there imposed as it seemed by habit or some studied trick upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness a flair for the cruder things of life 	3.3305267240182466

 providential you came on the scene 	16.726493381828078

 corny kelleher laughs pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding 	6.0676802571942305

 two commercials that were standing fizz in jammet’ <initial> like princes faith 	4.1182164587388606

 one of them lost two quid on the race 	10.623480213116407

 no by god says <initial> not for old stagers like myself and yourself 	6.879811200393769

 he laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye 	4.26995027169937

 thanks be to god we have it in the house what eh do you follow me 	6.405607963633467

 hah hah hah bloom tries to laugh 	6.566211239465545

 the horse neighs 	20.32906079477783

 the horse hohohohohohoh hohohohome corny kelleher sure it was behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in mrs cohen’s and i told him to pull up and got off to see 	5.506573007511937

 sober hearsedrivers a speciality 	13.150446205127238

 will i give him a lift home 	10.291252239922331

 bloom no in sandycove i believe from what he let drop 	5.530144257895181

 stephen prone breathes to the stars 	16.132676878128077

 corny kelleher asquint drawls at the horse 	8.969727434968167

 bloom in gloom looms down 	7.930073655996815

 corny kelleher scratches his nape 	7.77175791658176

 sandycove he bends down and calls to stephen 	9.252798008816672

 eh he calls again 	18.725515157726885

 eh he’s covered with shavings anyhow 	13.42461869789354

 take care they didn’t lift anything off him 	5.829950123121518

 well i’ll shove along 	14.80107902607358

 he laughs 	45.32167065902992

 i’ve a rendezvous in the morning 	6.256677675161672

 burying the dead 	37.1170779344872

 safe home the horse neighs 	11.574712332714943

 bloom good night 	28.432794666357854

 i’ll just wait and take him along in a few 	7.685279226826866

 corny kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it 	8.161623199856086

 the horse harness jingles 	12.528834491090578

 corny kelleher from the car standing 	19.352810034148717

 bloom night 	151.6105150222872

 the jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly 	3.586789236238419

 the car and horse back slowly awkwardly and turn 	4.17967263059076

 corny kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at bloom’s plight 	5.788270308499987

 the jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat 	6.777575474819116

 bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply 	6.485776922070808

 with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done 	4.089300156447121

 with a slow nod bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs 	3.680179137126892

 the car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane 	7.619003497309958

 corny kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand 	6.837094965968092

 bloom with his hand assuralooms corny kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay 	11.915696737498635

 the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay 	3.009492029659912

 bloom holding in his hand stephen’s hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute 	5.374978438331574

 then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder 	10.578598115988314

 bloom eh ho there is no answer 	5.9017969464320705

 he bends again 	18.576911999309175

 mr dedalus there is no answer 	9.905429608350362

 the name if you call 	33.71823379090853

 he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form 	6.226430834346495

 stephen there is no answer 	11.993070727645364

 he calls again 	57.354162419834296

 stephen stephen groans 	28.598972427974687

 black panther 	150.9040089090698

 he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels 	2.6280110861130663

 wood’s woven shade 	44.78577387956291

 he turns on his left side sighing doubling himself together 	5.612375778857054

 bloom poetry 	151.6105150222872

 well educated 	155.5301068384996

 he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen’s waistcoat 	6.5207450907478615

 to breathe 	156.97886134051888

 he brushes the woodshavings from stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers 	4.1192025909279435

 one pound seven 	22.748763893288636

 not hurt anyhow 	20.51708817228107

 he listens 	174.00628612161748

 the woods  	156.4518051831419

 white breast 	94.83393341497049

 dim sea 	209.41671971432194

 he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body 	5.795471079172956

 bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect 	6.910479788886307

 a dog barks in the distance 	19.374742749467053

 bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant 	6.534214230794755

 he looks down on stephen’s face and form 	10.476589850648216

 bloom communes with the night 	24.171704108797577

 face reminds me of his poor mother 	14.01338761885141

 in the shady wood 	28.351663312599182

 the deep white breast 	17.68908167108411

 ferguson i think i caught 	16.76356551049197

 a girl 	84.6899648440745

 some girl 	139.94110054343398

 best thing could happen him 	7.062436178702669

 he murmurs 	63.6384822547158

 swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts 	3.1903738950929776

 he murmurs 	63.6384822547158

 a cabletow’s length from the shore 	18.532956381531847

 where the tide ebbs 	25.72350304474889

 and flows  	176.76243298217403

 silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master 	5.694663662779845

 against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand 	3.5562798922138144

 he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page 	3.152119979853139

 bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly 	12.313022172573524

 rudy rudy gazes unseeing into bloom’s eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling 	4.4082576821050585

 he has a delicate mauve face 	8.243715552952546

 on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons 	7.863224552397493

 in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot 	5.511776625966549

 a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket 	7.785717059542031

 — iii — <number> preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed 	3.779146210021729

 his stephen’s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabman’s shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral 	4.087712112804427

 but how to get there was the rub 	19.318743888384386

 for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned 	3.7547896837536134

 so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being <initial> <initial> ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found 	5.757221362338835

 accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’ <initial> but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice 	3.476381581396585

 this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did 	5.006127664663001

 so bevelling around by mullett’s and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance 	4.783639127213805

 so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey 	3.2067857408264557

 as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back 	4.740716847985918

 they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station 	2.7962926136835646

 between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke’s city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable 	3.994830507611754

 bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourke’s the baker’s it is said 	4.918962712221814

 en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out 	3.6609278749822485

 highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about 	4.077743697987147

 the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot 	4.50466161550998

 never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes 	4.129347748174373

 another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything 	2.7319256632286626

 you frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of £ 	4.471849215051713

 <initial> <initial> into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically 	3.2772925010544753

 most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs 	6.408260289476006

 —and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind 	5.693572077123035

 discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps 	3.634440884599395

 stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox 	5.372886101138574

 he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s gumley 	4.577937220646497

 to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge 	9.42631166319976

 —someone saluted you mr bloom said 	5.205569514086788

 a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling —night stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment 	3.4444830799655333

 mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least 	3.263709733618294

 though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted 	3.0510217244470046

 stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice 	4.7701179984653574

 lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise 	5.952670022080336

 he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer 	5.25546989071482

 his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot 	3.684502822048372

 rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen 	3.539127952017302

 this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley 	2.5932767962312204

 taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell 	4.737972612968796

 not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings 	8.73136177433093

 his friends had all deserted him 	7.202275842269833

 furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions 	6.018956586865698

 he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something anything at all to do 	6.193666944397527

 no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish 	6.110539190645564

 anyhow he was all in 	32.86887566698196

 —i wouldn’t ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows i’m on the rocks 	4.959241943753457

 —there’ll be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher 	6.696056162759229

 mr garrett deasy 	23.575848402103563

 try it 	57.65683841172556

 you may mention my name 	8.129033050800453

 —ah god corley replied sure i couldn’t teach in a school man 	5.180984223691186

 i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh 	8.721037297757318

 i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers 	13.292413827246715

 —i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him 	4.041848117126334

 corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street 	6.688097259474413

 there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloney’s but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m’conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob 	4.4058459857808305

 he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it 	6.645254380457592

 though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence 	4.732462244475223

 however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished 	4.030727715978833

 but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful 	6.078604515426354

 a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation 	13.954494572365862

 he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact 	5.05786952081757

 he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect 	4.571262253748346

 about biscuits he dimly remembered 	7.362908604060495

 who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy 	5.252749716558772

 however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out 	4.856338768910653

 —those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him 	3.822801259322929

 and so in point of fact they turned out to be 	6.6374715691016775

 stephen anyhow lent him one of them 	10.502821857847367

 —thanks corley answered you’re a gentleman 	5.075701280451243

 i’ll pay you back one time 	4.873563320123699

 who’s that with you 	13.392822546620511

 i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker 	6.350011221005698

 i’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks man 	7.587485924023899

 i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper 	4.687606542632866

 subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam’s the shipchandler’s bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with o’mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe 	6.233867601781193

 anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable 	4.848971724293538

 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept 	4.066371320560195

 he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when 	4.364742814310738

 being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity 	3.68329851526219

 palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether 	6.212917616077942

 in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning 	5.174213789473529

 pretty thick that was certainly 	21.91758659479844

 the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite 	6.953450375024338

 alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is —he is down on his luck 	10.961586952617184

 he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman 	5.362560937231624

 at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively —everybody gets their own ration of luck they say 	3.942215826952795

 now you mention it his face was familiar to me 	6.14967054064416

 but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive 	5.813419104542895

 —half a crown stephen responded 	6.567130915383898

 i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere 	7.736404389451467

 —needs mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does 	4.571440168499814

 everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds 	8.547666413702448

 but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself 	5.972869108634787

 walking to sandycove is out of the question 	9.614654367191468

 and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station 	5.102847665459352

 simply fag out there for nothing 	14.141907938055123

 i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house 	4.282415724375695

 —to seek misfortune was stephen’s answer 	8.982968294049686

 —i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday 	4.470213952083916

 where does he live at present 	6.883047874742085

 i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved 	10.315642472636814

 —i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly 	10.003050623437131

 —a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one 	5.017133101039509

 he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you 	5.140285084090484

 you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did 	4.202741660647535

 there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that 	3.7941022266482207

 —no mr bloom repeated again i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes 	3.1723131060393177

 he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals 	3.6703594974938745

 of course you didn’t notice as much as i did 	6.702267955134549

 but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object 	4.771416974556084

 he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it 	3.1856648272219186

 was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple 	3.8753957364639247

 —except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out 	6.3236445602810285

 the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less 	3.2295184583863197

 grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet 	2.7558416510198485

 adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties 	3.2200214936097327

 — puttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini ho ragione 	2.846189876070495

 culo rotto —intendiamoci 	14.471237670438626

 mezzo sovrano più 	35.26475749699104

 —dice lui però —mezzo 	5.71618728039521

 —farabutto mortacci sui —ma ascolta cinque la testa più 	2.859840509564509

 mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the goat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in 	4.284339687949644

 a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity 	2.481610199110876

 —now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description 	3.577267578545364

 accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly 	3.3674686161453824

 the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor 	2.186382824672778

 mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious —a beautiful language 	4.177022298813932

 i mean for singing purposes 	8.01630619588942

 bella poetria it is so melodious and full 	7.055559461044305

 stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied —to fill the ear of a cow elephant 	4.43447692875056

 they were haggling over money 	9.733991370358092

 —is that so 	11.85505885091363

 mr bloom asked 	14.820510492604598

 of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it 	2.505928189607219

 the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête à tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed 	5.547582109320952

 after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to 	5.307745617985716

 for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him 	4.36651002117178

 —sounds are impostures stephen said after a pause of some little time like names 	5.014162234359109

 cicero podmore napoleon mr goodbody 	8.480169657860364

 jesus mr doyle 	38.82234837444643

 shakespeares were as common as murphies 	8.398185220271227

 what’s in a name 	14.740573049395428

 —yes to be sure mr bloom unaffectedly concurred 	12.510911603912149

 of course 	26.681421798297652

 our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across 	4.150212935542704

 the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking —and what might your name be 	3.933725824043609

 just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered —dedalus 	4.633161389517982

 the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water 	3.1387677615725305

 —you know simon dedalus 	12.01482692676852

 he asked at length 	10.918323127338008

 —i’ve heard of him stephen said 	7.656326233723573

 mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too 	6.567185742133166

 —he’s irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding 	4.4487083979488595

 all irish 	157.04395939975703

 —all too irish stephen rejoined 	6.048940089933014

 as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark —i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder 	4.826800247294079

 the lefthand dead shot 	12.50806960258624

 though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain 	5.9026795221333765

 —bottles out there say 	12.278511927831014

 fifty yards measured 	50.860581347030305

 eggs on the bottles 	80.22802392668652

 cocks his gun over his shoulder 	7.682969927081609

 ai <title> he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely 	5.140918364416419

 then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance 	4.055441419479731

 —pom he then shouted once 	7.584226982963001

 the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg 	2.6616191119083896

 —pom he shouted twice 	8.619490362152307

 egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily —buffalo bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will 	2.0639894388098896

 a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley 	4.54845709521445

 —beg pardon the sailor said 	6.886881807899112

 —long ago 	32.67479702455199

 mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth 	5.3660144548175985

 —why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years 	4.635869646863664

 he toured the wide world with hengler’s royal circus 	6.6310871558768065

 i seen him do that in stockholm 	13.18803824409664

 —curious coincidence mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively 	9.047780962059061

 —murphy’s my name the sailor continued 	14.98156203665213

 <initial> <initial> murphy of carrigaloe 	8.184178322912963

 know where that is 	24.759634845600996

 —queenstown harbour stephen replied 	9.305371970554495

 —that’s right the sailor said 	6.033739290794249

 fort camden and fort carlisle 	8.480169657860364

 that’s where i hails from 	6.706784480116915

 i belongs there 	32.86970981762285

 that’s where i hails from 	6.706784480116915

 my little woman’s down there 	14.05532483371052

 she’s waiting for me i know 	13.67858549947603

 she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now sailing about 	3.7287664918412133

 mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon 	3.92760074896654

 across the world for a wife 	20.267566452575455

 quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o’leary a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way 	2.9366528359787196

 never about the runaway wife coming back however much devoted to the absentee 	6.726825500708487

 the face at the window judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half wrecked in his affections 	4.772237904456549

 you little expected me but i’ve come to stay and make a fresh start 	7.219208534175944

 there she sits a grasswidow at the selfsame fireside 	7.013823735986211

 believes me dead rocked in the cradle of the deep 	12.988979966530366

 and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin as the case might be the publican of the crown and anchor in shirtsleeves eating rumpsteak and onions 	3.517107608901174

 no chair for father 	12.389689518422285

 broo the wind her brandnew arrival is on her knee post mortem child 	5.265011991195747

 with a high ro and a randy ro and my galloping tearing tandy o bow to the inevitable 	5.576822631061266

 grin and bear it 	14.471237670438626

 i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband <initial> <initial> murphy 	5.313719796764399

 the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request —you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you 	6.7563798470134735

 the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand 	5.063766783274862

 he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded —we come up this morning eleven o’clock 	4.422300263940034

 the threemaster rosevean from bridgwater with bricks 	4.4174165258030245

 i shipped to get over 	21.078304310983636

 <initial> <initial> <initial> in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document 	3.7028420480630033

 —you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter 	7.701656940784532

 —why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it i’ve circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on 	4.2343631934885995

 i was in the red sea 	15.839720486402804

 i was in china and north america and south america 	5.103461955929217

 we was chased by pirates one voyage 	4.837456185556585

 i seen icebergs plenty growlers 	8.60080875958323

 i was in stockholm and the black sea the dardanelles under captain dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship 	4.299367590009539

 i seen russia 	36.10484503213194

 gospodi pomilyou  	209.41671971432194

 that’s how the russians prays 	10.653945543384696

 —you seen queer sights don’t be talking put in a jarvey 	6.3348984924840455

 —why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug 	2.713201651288919

 i seen queer things too ups and downs 	4.97706491662732

 i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid 	4.068419072088897

 he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously —khaan like that 	3.350674318003508

 and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses 	5.0595694993974565

 look here 	174.2838447230328

 here they are 	28.832796860364923

 a friend of mine sent me 	7.775108756415291

 he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table 	4.125624632538498

 the printed matter on it stated choza de indios 	5.277007879795248

 mr bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark 	3.226233227826629

 it ran as follows tarjeta postal señor a boudin galeria becche santiago chile 	2.2339355666164735

 there was no message evidently as he took particular notice 	6.928428145123719

 though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo don cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <initial> <initial> somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest 	3.761171034144392

 martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through 	3.813259189640435

 but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear purse permitting a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back 	3.718385002890835

 the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth falmouth southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with 	3.1703603753968057

 another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas eastbourne scarborough margate and so on beautiful bournemouth the channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative 	2.5683746298948495

 not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness mrs c p m’coy type lend me your valise and i’ll post you the ticket 	4.234486306382971

 no something top notch an all star irish caste the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure 	2.7379864208957776

 but who 	98.44511695646139

 that was the rub 	19.211593707139382

 also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguard rosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally 	4.40785975936053

 a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man <initial> <initial> brown robinson and co 	2.9856773639283576

 it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife 	4.098612126084123

 there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow rightly termed the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup d’œil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise silken thomas grace o’malley george iv rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar 	3.0352258277811495

 because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired 	5.593996308185211

 he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen 	6.954712092724234

 —i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different 	4.025812792349567

 his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to 	2.324061096238622

 —that’s a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable stiletto  	3.546954934242996

 —they’re great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all 	6.2497422942589465

 that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives 	5.696136502641358

 at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr <initial> and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skin the goat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair 	2.96838997696732

 his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on 	3.9778708554695066

 funny very there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause 	3.4659742856843003

 one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seaman’s discharge 	4.091759606723892

 mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood 	5.536038640587668

 he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen 	4.587791440123668

 —ay boss the sailor broke in 	6.59903738410573

 give us back them papers 	11.168635197388602

 the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape 	5.299752912408492

 —have you seen the rock of gibraltar 	5.48245825682407

 mr bloom inquired 	40.010835834749116

 the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no 	3.9786989317511687

 —ah you’ve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn 	4.68319658149128

 —what year would that be about 	5.991180751696072

 mr b interrogated 	42.518138636363105

 can you recall the boats 	7.226052234215086

 our soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering —i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships 	4.22817110231927

 salt junk all the time 	10.557326845433845

 tired seemingly he ceased 	13.150446205127238

 his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves 	4.708614140121928

 on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings 	3.1892225648215944

 and it left him wondering why 	8.94058812883635

 possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates 	5.10303375303311

 and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all 	5.5245471177091305

 nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather 	3.580088420047207

 —there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month 	4.344598004434413

 them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife 	10.668006584504655

 i’m game for that job shaving and brushup 	5.076032368331103

 i hate roaming about 	17.938081557376908

 there’s my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money 	5.912333479379833

 —what age is he 	10.637535036546494

 queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage 	4.1725459657128665

 —why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny 	4.5426392756864695

 he’d be about eighteen now way i figure it 	3.6110718593890265

 the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor 	2.9983975455029785

 —there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts 	3.874967826562214

 i must get a wash tomorrow or next day 	5.853202592060827

 it’s them black lads i objects to 	4.433498067354841

 suck your blood dry they does 	5.938413718914424

 seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <number> and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather 	6.61984274990472

 —tattoo the exhibitor explained 	8.100796810646182

 that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton 	4.1342633330049265

 fellow the name of antonio done that 	7.744831090001221

 there he is himself a greek 	11.156875084050586

 —did it hurt much doing it 	7.003550097407207

 one asked the sailor 	16.1037209807104

 that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the 	3.6758852622829936

 someway in his 	35.26475749699104

 squeezing or 	209.41671971432194

 —see here he said showing antonio 	10.997606824158266

 there he is cursing the mate 	8.821873386007661

 and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn 	6.199258862588591

 and in point of fact the young man named antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin the goat who this time stretched over 	2.9899924708954875

 —ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest 	5.423173497521001

 he’s gone too 	13.07371713299661

 ate by sharks after 	14.471237670438626

 ay ay 	91.50270484977463

 he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before 	5.584354998525857

 —neat bit of work one longshoreman said 	6.103896899303378

 —and what’s the number for 	10.65189957006695

 loafer number two queried 	17.209298800581017

 —eaten alive 	32.67479702455199

 a third asked the sailor 	9.505447004675597

 —ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number 	5.224479105835877

 a greek he was 	18.84848616073685

 and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end —as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio 	3.311832384953533

 the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill 	4.931109367137818

 mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink 	4.935410683077651

 his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs <initial> and begged the chance of his washing 	4.681383388267806

 also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing 	2.9491021148265295

 still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with bewley and draper’s marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt 	4.1375572140936585

 still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off 	4.793072391850493

 round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her 	4.2447741854115275

 —the gunboat the keeper said 	7.012585014547189

 unfortunate creature of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition 	7.09581416194109

 still no matter what the cause is from 	8.01597225762127

 stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking —in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade 	3.860865547304575

 fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul 	4.207683932721667

 she is a bad merchant 	24.794279430321076

 she buys dear and sells cheap 	6.912279601400203

 the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start 	3.798670664156593

 whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned 	4.337037873830468

 —you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul 	7.3832542048764225

 or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup 	3.88431215559331

 i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter 	7.596135979374273

 otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance 	3.6610680794254824

 do you 	21.201910615422126

 thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say —they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible 	4.594581011369651

 it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette 	3.5000054642161813

 of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon 	3.8680037804828444

 but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god 	6.2703032854851575

 —o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence 	3.1104756866227903

 on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed 	4.3385005861340185

 —has been 	28.760249464552032

 the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief 	7.737867742723776

 i’m not so sure about that 	5.23096346342323

 that’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there 	5.009383755280493

 my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i needn’t tell you 	3.255681104073602

 can’t you drink that coffee by the way 	5.347132191608666

 let me stir it 	14.11138914064767

 and take a piece of that bun 	20.20987458751845

 it’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised 	13.174630024490028

 still no one can give what he hasn’t got 	9.539412961390633

 try a bit 	40.33122542830918

 —couldn’t stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further 	6.245008045768543

 faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work 	4.1587199869185065

 to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders 	2.940238947659343

 on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying 	4.49784242988278

 the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of 	4.731913683173023

 sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where 	4.795101994339383

 anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble’s vi cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved 	4.41761718950591

 —have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred 	8.811220446113003

 thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage 	5.664335393950106

 —still it’s solid food his good genius urged i’m a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual 	3.1819779077785317

 you ought to eat more solid food 	6.84170143779041

 you would feel a different man 	7.4558091251190755

 —liquids i can eat stephen said 	8.298948531938485

 but o oblige me by taking away that knife 	4.925219551858437

 i can’t look at the point of it 	10.93714163235896

 it reminds me of roman history 	9.859347279015722

 mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it 	3.012838267043641

 —our mutual friend’s stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce  	4.958758653492192

 do you think they are genuine 	15.61165997606143

 he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots 	3.4826061047566403

 look at him 	19.901240769544923

 yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel 	3.9521118401678796

 he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him 	5.953458717520814

 though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity 	3.1308266811080956

 he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described 	3.4450427134375405

 on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera 	2.172347137123202

 and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him 	3.6263393743542034

 —mind you i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention he resumed 	6.8478078256180055

 analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with 	5.165783192805228

 giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way marcella the midget queen 	4.7188079098906295

 there’s an example again of simple souls 	5.821520215402266

 however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded 	3.284733022475775

 on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap 	3.4603265131909327

 —spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as old nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen 	3.82462913391897

 it comes from the great heat climate generally 	14.842528607873017

 point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically spain <initial> <initial> gibraltar 	4.885721310001551

 she has the spanish type 	21.255276742243385

 quite dark regular brunette black 	7.579411573290009

 i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character 	4.254701032000421

 that’s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian 	6.526199616055706

 —the temperaments at the door stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings 	3.929485862670714

 roberto ruba roba sua  	14.471237670438626

 —quite so mr bloom dittoed 	18.349576125941983

 —then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino 	3.062466690369652

 —it’s in the blood mr bloom acceded at once 	8.610899456405306

 all are washed in the blood of the sun 	8.652182155778053

 coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there 	4.923725907801917

 the splendid proportions of hips bosom 	6.471134133485967

 you simply don’t knock against those kind of women here 	7.263566629017443

 an exception here and there 	7.698319736593508

 handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what i’m talking about is the female form 	7.392685538775417

 besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty no matter what you say 	3.7378664263454437

 rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see 	4.529812078529163

 interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing 	3.989859934790998

 shipahoy of course had his own say to say 	13.731717714661494

 he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him 	4.200037238143819

 so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt’s rock wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand 	4.349581321331319

 that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror 	3.7315671588381796

 then someone said something about the case of the <initial> <initial> lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck 	4.6064796463697295

 no aid was given 	12.389689518422285

 her master the mona ’s said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way 	6.217230957094064

 she had no water it appears in her hold 	7.670388351739004

 at this stage an incident happened 	6.297500042884703

 it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat 	4.231220976528424

 —let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze 	5.318649353283581

 he made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left 	6.508147536621156

 while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozzle to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise 	4.914938470051021

 the irrepressible bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved 	3.544543098031603

 some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank 	3.848819994714738

 a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled 	2.7258610858378427

 slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <number> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of 	2.8826169370570915

 and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver 	5.003764905304673

 he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality 	5.395706935790101

 all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing 	3.7012881710954377

 a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin the only launch that year 	3.8817375162145105

 there were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently au fait  	3.879601533324978

 what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that eh 	3.7481934857207047

 ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day’s work captain john lever of the lever line 	4.463984391987408

 —am i right skipper 	10.592304590442758

 he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions 	8.688771795638102

 that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds 	4.453300377603723

 mr bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question 	4.7554703695471545

 anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation cum potation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook —the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot’s wife’s arse 	4.288118278209658

 o johnny lever johnny lever o after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided 	3.0718381419100935

 skin the goat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god’s earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein 	3.613241392783499

 their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact 	6.234160289545541

 you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco 	4.243364297886221

 but a day of reckoning he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes 	3.666786033560886

 there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history 	10.834776182332265

 the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed 	7.284447084570979

 the boers were the beginning of the end 	18.46438444747159

 his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland 	4.627974810458254

 ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons 	7.093267297936408

 silence all round marked the termination of his finale  	9.000194775619699

 the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed 	3.856771365578314

 —take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism 	4.232111653559945

 to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view 	4.793678793007568

 —who’s the best troops in the army 	10.09640912116461

 the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated 	5.3884045333067405

 and the best jumpers and racers 	9.829618042517367

 and the best admirals and generals we’ve got 	7.763612673385376

 tell me that 	44.92915714414744

 —the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial blemishes apart 	3.3447281915654465

 —that’s right the old tarpaulin corroborated 	6.957701895671302

 the irish catholic peasant 	15.517476279004786

 he’s the backbone of our empire 	8.307677328464488

 you know jem mullins 	16.821951387206585

 then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows 	4.275647575271445

 from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite 	3.4357748323035158

 it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart 	4.943043492680864

 and now why 	39.28441207240326

 so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game 	5.523358087711225

 and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn’t the other person at all he <initial> couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated 	3.9733546439051692

 quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle 	4.052678935930632

 yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skin the goat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on 	3.383737387087805

 in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo skin the etcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome 	4.924838958063672

 he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high 	5.586918638266113

 like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again 	3.1688057456672523

 generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow 	7.367512928671559

 so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £ 	5.422082686861733

 <initial> <initial> in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on 	7.443443636569719

 then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender 	7.402331399367185

 —he took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared i let slip 	4.596517291229671

 he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively 	11.231107598515266

 so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i’m not 	5.5529705484443665

 that was one for him 	17.873283838860797

 a soft answer turns away wrath 	6.549016707637552

 he hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw 	7.612688455799588

 am i not right 	19.488732256449765

 he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly 	5.130296566820727

 — ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing christus or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum carnem  	3.078315384302978

 —of course mr <initial> proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question 	7.554748342605643

 it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves 	2.8024653786629035

 but with a little goodwill all round 	13.430648678584191

 it’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality 	3.4223620988086463

 i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form 	3.5985006591416115

 it never reaches anything or stops anything 	4.422338940035905

 a revolution must come on the due instalments plan 	10.802390033991504

 it’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak 	4.69108494826036

 —memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war stephen assented between skinner’s alley and ormond market 	2.8958421329338537

 yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark that was overwhelmingly right 	5.593039875690348

 and the whole world was full of that sort of thing 	9.88118676100697

 —you just took the words out of my mouth he said 	9.857144079397854

 a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely 	4.106851783215247

 all those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop 	3.159312931508954

 —they accuse remarked he audibly 	5.390163789428589

 he turned away from the others who probably… and spoke nearer to so as the others… in case they… —jews he softly imparted in an aside in stephen’s ear are accused of ruining 	3.432605184567577

 not a vestige of truth in it i can safely say 	6.784790241260178

 history would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them 	2.8143558300761575

 because they are imbued with the proper spirit 	18.55466290562352

 they are practical and are proved to be so 	5.807902383651708

 i don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are 	5.854921220410368

 but in the economic not touching religion domain the priest spells poverty 	5.753009690791984

 it’s in the dogma 	20.198409578569727

 because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better at least so i think 	4.8630324544688985

 that’s the juggle on which the <initial> <initial> ’s raise the wind on false pretences 	6.506168875813797

 i’m he resumed with dramatic force as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashion either something in the neighbourhood of £ <number> per annum 	2.6101335574296285

 that’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man 	4.131014441212415

 at least that’s my idea for what it’s worth 	12.47126607884339

 i call that patriotism 	20.14396168937039

 where you can live well the sense is if you work 	9.65330953075438

 over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general stephen stared at nothing in particular 	5.012505749931957

 he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to 	3.9742282727533005

 then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said if you work 	7.887672227232116

 —count me out he managed to remark meaning work 	4.306257930387056

 the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem 	4.883793132575975

 observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together 	4.642658312801199

 —i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense 	6.636718109150669

 also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing 	6.569863838699246

 writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays 	9.852094610584254

 that’s work too 	11.89664857932213

 important work 	209.41671971432194

 after all from the little i know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price 	6.301349065424591

 you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has 	4.741659982695521

 you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn 	8.916388450137738

 each is equally important 	12.012977749024797

 —you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short 	4.873158814186105

 —i would go a step farther mr bloom insinuated 	9.428558690955706

 —but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me 	4.490434732242805

 —what belongs queried mr bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension 	5.547269531052377

 excuse me 	78.56227743891934

 unfortunately i didn’t catch the latter portion 	10.624611023536751

 what was it you 	17.47131771570526

 stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding —we can’t change the country 	3.5189605302296334

 at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry 	4.757254339000372

 the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part 	6.292118688007177

 needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state 	4.750922362340435

 all the same bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years 	4.166467936531563

 highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly inadvisable all things considered 	5.725377831100317

 something evidently riled them in his death 	15.32252926304573

 either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands 	2.7613314758887992

 of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility 	3.015701856644204

 naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they weren’t even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between 	3.5109860452587993

 a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first 	5.1074447326731915

 this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage  	4.402231182671548

 as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings 	4.342806348584318

 first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into 	3.4410438153663168

 since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of 	3.6161594021204193

 whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved one’s smiles 	5.199218354859461

 the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up 	9.559530668847506

 can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk 	4.712774181536492

 though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly 	4.2043286741396635

 a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons the 18th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick 	3.9379602086683736

 looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream 	7.0732085088158625

 and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times 	4.777646552875691

 why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side 	4.354549291873463

 north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldn’t do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds 	3.449545109746986

 stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue 	3.9155306185440444

 her the lady’s eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublin’s premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution 	5.066849613864362

 in or about ninety six 	10.32328617888062

 very like her then 	23.897895384946438

 beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen 	4.004938945479846

 as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup 	6.134942114407536

 she could without difficulty he said have posed for the ensemble not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the 	5.027549128849646

 he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum 	4.754666221971491

 yes puritanisme it does though saint joseph’s sovereign thievery alors bandez figne toi trop 	3.431050378409889

 whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word 	7.288039121322561

 but it was scarcely professional etiquette so 	8.728182363371772

 though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm 	4.307059273911754

 and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion 	4.637038627313572

 nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint  	2.6517698677593424

 in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out 	3.8708505254629726

 suppose she was gone when he 	11.335382558995715

 i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray 	3.93441867169004

 the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated distingué and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would 	5.614237416866319

 besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter 	7.9626614173284755

 and why not 	31.196014160909527

 an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business 	3.301577502104294

 how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate 	2.7425575066613606

 then the decree nisi and the king’s proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it nisi was made absolute 	4.7791518936953565

 but as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course 	4.493729273757706

 he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader’s who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader’s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o’brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals 	4.9051675676682995

 though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive 	2.867124593222116

 as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character 	5.306699856582701

 his hat parnell’s a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave 	4.61790877917615

 on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others 	3.4447771350241356

 he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt 	3.0181772441799164

 it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime 	2.7610295164628127

 in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs 	3.5561093327026208

 to think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age 	3.880837353013667

 the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely humpty dumpty boiled 	3.2746865246534855

 —at what o’clock did you dine 	11.002996142403639

 he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face 	6.067100113171763

 —some time yesterday stephen said 	5.500076237336936

 —yesterday exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday 	6.43800439619851

 ah you mean it’s after twelve —the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself 	6.521314888795889

 literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected 	6.599830865870693

 though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought 	3.629969738004994

 at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas 	3.0026174158484698

 for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in people’s mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word 	2.8940780623254794

 anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night 	6.878618987336805

 the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak 	3.3598370569824807

 on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives 	6.684651104445369

 everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered 	8.807497093433204

 his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway 	6.1770157670571635

 for one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable 	4.4510554272674785

 at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up 	4.218786600278015

 at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew 	4.576710064242236

 people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep 	5.639478515943986

 the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles 	7.000965378790865

 your god was a jew 	8.688945941583892

 because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick on shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo 	4.634097353767808

 —i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over 	3.1589060306722208

 my diggings are quite close in the vicinity 	8.604777738545621

 you can’t drink that stuff 	11.426038413824466

 do you like cocoa 	28.35005921777336

 i’ll just pay this lot 	4.776897396837469

 the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to 	3.625013270122098

 —yes that’s the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less 	4.377022019946655

 all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his b’s busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck 	3.138073106652579

 an opening was all was wanted 	10.43056089239783

 because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to 	5.074719418446632

 the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in london somewhere 	5.811031925551268

 then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect 	4.454995274686194

 —give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience 	3.0083326656035

 —and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed 	3.8821813181981986

 the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears 	5.196724939041095

 —are you bad in the eyes 	15.430008180578426

 the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried 	8.746998095001446

 —why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as i uses goggles reading 	3.9647968995159673

 sand in the red sea done that 	14.243759750752574

 one time i could read a book in the dark manner of speaking 	11.11049559392412

 the arabian nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she 	4.48228091997661

 hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of king willow iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts during which time completely regardless of ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark 	2.5135699163239553

 —come he counselled to close the séance  	4.723166075639096

 seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente  	3.9700209467121366

 stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door 	3.6222135106739124

 —one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment 	14.376219740194475

 why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafés 	6.659297533837138

 to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation saying straight off —to sweep the floor in the morning 	4.311405803835104

 so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles 	4.746417379342836

 the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins 	4.680092915106379

 —it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment 	8.729359717089341

 the only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man 	8.079672046843225

 lean on me 	29.459844279595302

 accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly 	8.320259015004561

 —yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that 	5.050579534079901

 anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc 	4.4450991441343435

 where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new 	3.1049540060268352

 and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings 	4.064412103704534

 so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place 	3.945900152665706

 he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be  	3.663294257057351

 he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini’s stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or virtuosi rather 	3.453491495238763

 there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore 	5.027462418631628

 on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a penchant though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn 	3.582697998350914

 and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned par excellence lionel’s air in martha m’appari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephen’s respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat 	4.047067976519197

 stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare’s songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno ludendo hausi doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom <initial> did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd william who played the virginals he said in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull 	2.5139440444053265

 on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull 	3.515857864299435

 he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence 	4.571473707348594

 by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other’s sleeve gently jocosely remarking —our lives are in peril tonight 	3.406364323536688

 beware of the steamroller 	95.3456528571186

 they thereupon stopped 	29.38803583308196

 bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts 	3.537931482958217

 but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up 	4.423192433954058

 he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world 	6.186344939388566

 but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernan’s of the same size would be a holy horror to face 	5.8001297740437305

 but it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump 	6.388233787454148

 nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees 	3.9417888586008165

 whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye 	4.480343204060235

 these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old 	4.8826411588019605

 —what’s this i was saying 	11.160311751301816

 ah yes my wife he intimated plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind 	3.221417059291021

 he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built 	5.60175025406976

 still supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall’s irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general 	5.031844611747377

 exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from 	2.5462590205244022

 even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled bloom a bit von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten 	3.040358942227392

 these opening bars he sang and translated extempore  	4.336049611773626

 bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did 	6.396282505241912

 a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of <initial> <initial> a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you 	2.903860959792048

 it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on record—in fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have 	4.150936930552497

 added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees 	5.7567585610492635

 not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time 	3.0555044391052517

 but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped 	3.600437447499938

 besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne  	3.00228999795471

 yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows 	4.284426249697701

 and it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone 	3.8604124524175094

 in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all 	6.237766684991903

 the horse was just then 	16.46456911139317

 and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character no pun intended 	3.4247004034604234

 the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds 	2.6895532520290133

 slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired 	5.471913951508076

 and humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car 	6.135093163550565

 side by side bloom profiting by the contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards gardiner street lower stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad 	3.8716405914966785

 und alle schiffe brücken 	14.471237670438626

 the driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge to be married by father maher  	3.308285446590334

 as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tête à tête which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of man’s reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car  	4.418043969836625

 <number> what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning 	6.229488683651076

 starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place 	2.3911739321918724

 approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before george’s church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends 	2.7062286687644326

 of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary 	6.040156558853015

 music literature ireland dublin paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephen’s collapse 	2.6355789453415097

 did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience 	2.869630215650128

 both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial 	2.381295763063365

 both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence 	4.320370532119059

 both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines 	1.8212819763657253

 both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism 	3.0779049366709694

 were their views on some points divergent 	9.004742824118706

 stephen dissented openly from bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature 	5.002224209952703

 bloom assented covertly to stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year <number> in the reign of leary to the year <number> or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart † <number> <initial> <initial> suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree 	3.6886711088766058

 the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a woman’s hand 	2.4073807150286863

 was there one point on which their views were equal and negative 	5.457149493490466

 the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees 	3.913091532160178

 what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently 	3.6834153308062736

 a temporary departure of his cat 	16.982558539322735

 why similarly why differently 	12.790951603714221

 similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian  	4.981058860839133

 differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation 	10.825005954136074

 in other respects were their differences similar 	6.968954100966229

 in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness 	4.753815427630258

 inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her cf neckarching cat  	4.415225714383025

 hence in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness their differences were similar 	3.0316287463227662

 what proposal did bloom diambulist father of milly somnambulist make to stephen noctambulist 	4.702950369487285

 to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday proper and friday normal on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess 	3.552120229535238

 for the host rejuvenation of intelligence vicarious satisfaction 	7.154899886078927

 for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation 	3.46282682432266

 what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions 	3.943242804073476

 the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert hengler’s circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clown’s papa 	4.219051065037075

 was the clown bloom’s son 	13.828104581179101

 had bloom’s coin returned 	19.34456607729855

 why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him 	4.562424715610561

 because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity 	2.484151232825029

 he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions 	3.377669250207504

 there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay 	1.884942650301319

 why did he desist from speculation 	7.017421273886008

 because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed 	6.29140250632134

 did stephen participate in his dejection 	17.29313770742865

 he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void 	4.349175736343017

 was this affirmation apprehended by bloom 	6.777758565732005

 not verbally 	159.15451356945397

 that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void 	9.278406520395034

 in what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected 	4.453332628404547

 what did each do at the door of egress 	7.230066118624226

 bloom set the candlestick on the floor 	10.94488024320441

 stephen put the hat on his head 	11.835321425629026

 for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress 	8.232450124019785

 for a cat 	105.24839405980396

 what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden 	5.744049076790293

 the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit 	3.31961643345605

 with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations 	4.444378425264114

 meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis maior <number> lightyears <number> miles distant and in volume <number> times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <number> of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity 	2.436867930243012

 were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast 	3.305613982200273

 of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached 	2.2887212773420873

 why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result 	4.403901022908505

 because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places <initial> <initial> the 9th power of the 9th power of <number> that the result having been obtained <number> closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers 	3.514532271022879

 did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution 	4.216894836910509

 of a different order of difficulty 	20.79005350423439

 conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <number> tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity 	2.283505222404017

 and the problem of possible redemption 	10.809135903026752

 the minor was proved by the major 	9.86200995654467

 which various features of the constellations were in turn considered 	10.12885873288965

 his bloom’s logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error 	5.030094685327766

 that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman 	8.081453753493529

 that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence 	2.9462988657224773

 was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle 	15.392873111393916

 indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet 	5.574820428181877

 did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters 	2.825068441325688

 it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity 	2.6071792041740722

 what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman 	7.388297358853451

 her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations her nocturnal predominance her satellitic dependence her luminary reflection her constancy under all her phases rising and setting by her appointed times waxing and waning the forced invariability of her aspect her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation her potency over effluent and refluent waters her power to enamour to mortify to invest with beauty to render insane to incite to and aid delinquency the tranquil inscrutability of her visage the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity her omens of tempest and of calm the stimulation of her light her motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible 	1.6625277444100177

 how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp 	2.9653940897327047

 both then were silent 	11.861192511507529

 silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces 	5.546967444254167

 were they indefinitely inactive 	24.301371018986806

 at stephen’s suggestion at bloom’s instigation both first stephen then bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first bloom’s then stephen’s elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow 	3.364411500065099

 the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar bloom’s longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution <number> scholars stephen’s higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure 	3.7361098912441055

 by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress 	2.770777832645519

 how did they take leave one of the other in separation 	9.902327227142061

 standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles 	3.9786996398766123

 the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george 	15.283337677586802

 where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south to glasnevin in the north 	5.869031468489972

 alone what did bloom hear 	18.560281362747922

 the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane 	6.810791810465076

 the disparition of three final stars the diffusion of daybreak the apparition of a new solar disk 	3.8693360242077683

 had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena 	11.002435618749828

 once in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle kimmage he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon seated on a wall his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach the east 	4.3334822824381325

 he remembered the initial paraphenomena 	11.302431724781233

 did he remain 	43.05685785638722

 one a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere which repelled in recoil had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration 	2.318170973425369

 with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects 	3.9025089473849524

 with strain elevating a candlestick with pain feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence with attention focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active with solicitation bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe with amusement remembering dr malachi mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green with pleasure repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration 	2.0097872971567603

 his next proceeding 	35.96657497848114

 from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone one inch in height placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled agendath netaim unfolded the same examined it superficially rolled it into a thin cylinder ignited it in the candleflame applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion 	3.6921816520146233

 • <number> yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <number> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <number> / <number> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come <number> or <number> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <number> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die <number> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered <number> teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea <number> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give <number> points in <number> to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <number> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <number> big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <number> / <number> after <number> when i saw the <number> dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him <number> or <number> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <number> acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <number> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <number> / <number> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <number> / in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <number> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <number> years more i have of life up to <number> no im what am i at all ill be <number> in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she <number> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page <number> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <number> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <number> of the <number> wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into <number> of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that <number> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <number> with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about <number> minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today im glad i burned the half of those old freemans and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c i’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <number> rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you i sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it

adore well now dearest doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also captain grove with love yrs affly hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <number> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the <number> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones of course i had everything all to myself then a girl hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after when i put on my gloves and hat at the window to show i was going out not a notion what i meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when i half frowned at him outside westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter and the card from milly this morning see she wrote a letter to him who did i get the last letter from o mrs dwenn now what possessed her

 mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <number> or a <number> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because <number> drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <number> times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in <number> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <number> years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about <number> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out

bit of a short shift i had up to heat myself i loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and i in my skin hopping around i used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance i put out the light too so then there were <number> of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow i hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at <number> in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago

or a picnic suppose we all gave <number> / each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who mrs fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <number> consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news <number> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <number> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <number> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what <number> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at <number> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her <number> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us <number> days every <number> or <number> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <number> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about <number> weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <number> and <number> times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <number> minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after <number> years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <number> sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait <number> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their <number> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <number> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <number> / in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats <number> years ago now yes hed be <number> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the <number> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <number> queens and the <number> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <number> red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait <number> i was married <number> milly is <number> yesterday <number> what age was he then at dillons <number> or <number> about <number> i suppose hes <number> or more im not too old for him if hes <number> or <number> i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in <number> / <number> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from <number> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <number> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <number> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <number> lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <number> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <number> 7s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <number> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <number> he can make it for <number> im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only <number> / <number> or <number> / <number> ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <number> or <number> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <number> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want £ <number> or perhaps <number> / ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent <number> or <number> questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he

i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <number> years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas <number> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes 	3.7558225199127504
