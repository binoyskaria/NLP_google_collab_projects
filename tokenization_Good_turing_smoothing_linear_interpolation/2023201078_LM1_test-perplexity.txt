 her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home 	 474.31345264571553

 <title> bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight 	 245.52328183905587

 his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously 	 610.5088985139743

 allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer 	 173.03404648415938

 the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first 	 222.83120477272584

 at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him 	 462.01520084334066

 <title> bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on <title> bingley 	 128.38517580695114

 and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses 	 445.5034755092491

 i want to talk very seriously 	 137.61529791375102

 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 	 391.9524832828567

 she repented though she hardly knew of what 	 282.2904251599043

 not at all 	 15.07675571660856

 but you how are you 	 59.13576344173799

 there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning 	 167.45509711682777

 if indeed such a report is in existence 	 197.82364893644385

 now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy 	 433.56557515523724

 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man 	 142.64719469344695

 it will save me a world of trouble and economy 	 503.0643429144137

 your s & <initial> edw 	 16.602620034197976

 elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 	 284.01094251220195

 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone 	 341.976177779931

 do not distress me by the idea 	 243.03850073462164

 but i can guess how it was 	 71.98569934926957

 it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said <title> bennet and nothing can clear <title> collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn 	 407.6284733075543

 <title> hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves 	 217.84083793667048

 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street 	 213.85642196327956

 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 	 431.72405272513487

 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and <title> collins in describing the civility of <title> and <title> philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house 	 319.516076272813

 oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much 	 536.1321528569271

 and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses 	 325.8357885393233

 do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 	 250.4324168067723

 i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me 	 413.2152064203459

 he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 	 238.06326669788547

 as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public 	 235.3135031240818

 but that after their removal it had been every where discussed 	 287.3199361787711

 when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty 	 316.9485742711646

 a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her 	 508.1950519962503

 they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering 	 856.0172074720041

 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy 	 503.6606775219388

 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand 	 555.1982808045731

 and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them 	 463.7787485717301

 i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers 	 205.86578407615417

 that is to say you had given your permission 	 397.86532944948243

 and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that <title> wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house 	 92.98988018543876

 and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as <title> bingley was incomprehensible 	 333.183785049892

 was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil 	 740.4845603268732

 it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions 	 201.8933776590787

 i cannot blame myself for having done thus much 	 407.8074843856517

 in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account 	 195.23198215649253

 i have heard much of your master s fine person said <title> gardiner looking at the picture 	 144.60750685006204

 and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page 	 312.88598075122127

 we can all plague and punish one another 	 773.0573342406589

 you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 	 89.43275001900902

 they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse 	 796.7472431055047

 he is gone to my father already 	 45.664533393348364

 but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence 	 49.741404794496866

 as they drove to <title> gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival 	 261.06043081370404

 if i may so express it he has a right to be proud 	 168.1077652522175

 i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle 	 263.0636544155324

 into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance 	 1000.0000000000013

 in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself 	 421.97146768203197

 for as to <title> darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false 	 307.5385515259748

 oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him 	 745.0450721062792

 it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you 	 374.96163426046576

 she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance 	 289.9483195786853

 and what is to divide them 	 48.55467505834934

 when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield 	 574.5753688982292

 but in vain 	 13.876258187095122

 if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer 	 252.08962916504126

 you cannot have been always at longbourn 	 98.80177861961164

 she answered him with cold civility 	 57.784799862217795

 and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him 	 78.38454241356685

 but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity 	 297.2789741696078

 it was kindly meant 	 87.96136975517899

 besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight 	 451.1017704444298

 his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire 	 247.5991351018075

 we are all in an uproar 	 146.26463787336067

 he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her 	 144.23357797423236

 at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 	 443.21942523147607

 and as <title> collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary 	 306.32715852295377

 never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings 	 628.2911997382296

 but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 	 216.39227984032843

 this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree 	 120.07676320240316

 five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing 	 111.43391910071632

 we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode 	 863.2189668068467

 said she 	 102.38979016745878

 but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for 	 137.84033543345268

 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 	 143.01512156928928

 jane was beyond competition her favourite child 	 344.11068683212426

 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london <title> collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself 	 307.86007970470047

 when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was 	 270.3737257532628

 limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within <number> days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from 	 246.69175271522653

 girls can i do any thing for you in meryton 	 515.7787859003142

 at length there was nothing more to be said 	 64.9626982153218

 her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 	 131.9333023989615

 does your charge give you much trouble 	 1103.8195912729825

 but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle 	 235.55337446827915

 elizabeth was distressed 	 52.11508663110507

 you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste 	 337.097824755626

 since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design 	 728.127457612643

 no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me 	 371.9371751018733

 the next morning however made an alteration 	 87.4787589872648

 chapter xix 	 422.2807935949913

 and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon 	 171.6997488598847

 is not he a charming man 	 77.34044899454638

 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man 	 279.7189295474416

 i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully 	 172.84378407998608

 miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure 	 269.0270861297124

 and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though <title> bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 	 319.0543466816958

 the idea of <title> collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish 	 364.39670384752793

 the gentleman experienced some change of feeling 	 581.2483181145896

 jane was not happy 	 56.62913228104294

 chapter xiii 	 422.2807935949913

 and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther 	 319.75036645842795

 but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation 	 170.04152897138064

 and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 	 603.0503601772774

 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman 	 338.71570839267844

 a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade 	 563.912808130942

 thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together 	 256.9585619313682

 his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party 	 496.14482049090196

 miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps 	 182.97952166512448

 and what sort of table do they keep 	 101.60998846179443

 but consider your daughters 	 332.8582073038946

 then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 	 222.4404638128707

 the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 	 87.12985007122744

 oh yes 	 24.351382546276113

 chapter ix 	 422.2807935949913

 what a charming amusement for young people this is <title> darcy there is nothing like dancing after all 	 254.3285419152132

 chapter <initial> within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate 	 219.31303685250816

 the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere 	 355.65370547901676

 the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men 	 124.92208357055988

 yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of 	 390.1623162984434

 and her residence there will probably be of some duration 	 266.8563917441561

 and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 	 250.43417909910286

 and their mother talked on of her dislike of <title> darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as <title> bingley s friend without being heard by either of them 	 160.7850370793971

 we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said <title> gardiner but perhaps to the lakes 	 201.4595236041628

 but now it was all too natural 	 116.6666603487413

 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them 	 54.735623853333045

 i am not likely to leave kent for some time 	 60.5234152605209

 others of the party were now applied to 	 293.6565677227051

 about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged 	 469.59059451172146

 her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture 	 534.845911603647

 and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 	 225.7220631722274

 they were brightened by the exercise 	 166.78368304191574

 but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend 	 126.98050525299188

 in as short a time as <title> collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both 	 246.98588750549615

 he has been accused of many faults at different times 	 141.29103131278808

 the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <title> darcy could not have 	 164.54767715313102

 and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley 	 154.8952341308415

 about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon 	 667.3619658834283

 her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters 	 698.9116389696118

 and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time 	 376.65894943977764

 yet why did he come 	 372.41810805809246

 but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy 	 278.70311729955966

 this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared 	 217.90395813000728

 elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name 	 130.34722663845596

 elizabeth would not observe her 	 89.64491130213855

 chapter viii 	 422.2807935949913

 his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family 	 311.2944960836673

 i will not be interrupted 	 18.540089414171497

 she followed him thither 	 62.15323292803386

 you alluded to something else 	 508.8291850925321

 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart 	 227.3421481837772

 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for <title> collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it 	 215.19449664436638

 if i have i shall be the last person to confess it 	 179.84282733411024

 <title> hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker 	 705.4358305652426

 i see your design bingley said his friend 	 506.7265354399866

 and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement 	 251.49721061969598

 but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry 	 600.4848111614455

 my mother means well 	 208.56264529575222

 they were all astonished 	 35.69387727923922

 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way 	 147.741674105171

 recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of 	 290.047917204166

 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself 	 521.7028362949585

 i hope you have destroyed the letter 	 148.04832686021223

 and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise 	 389.45042998274187

 <title> collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known 	 563.409315850504

 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham 	 372.09788911753793

 one came from her books and the other from her toilette 	 636.499884607332

 very true 	 52.632775957458634

 but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 	 157.85576726946627

 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable 	 165.72756077767195

 <initial> the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work 	 172.1065914136923

 away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech 	 1000.0000000000013

 elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 	 251.8598607711088

 i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when <title> denny comes back from town 	 360.9373431768586

 he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend 	 383.0670005043134

 my sisters may write to me  	 278.8683352979054

 there could not exist in the world two men over whom <title> darcy could have such boundless influence 	 395.0630390292925

 with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself 	 548.6672496965327

 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house 	 240.81557999223222

 thank god i have not that pain 	 510.8717357906725

 lydia my love ring the bell 	 45.89756686746485

 elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry 	 755.7539411456299

 i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it 	 92.68051228761387

 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 	 91.6333864154752

 and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long 	 471.3790728062681

 who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away 	 454.3725916138697

 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance 	 558.5093000526495

 we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man 	 232.06329240845682

 bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business 	 191.94912248656917

 and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 	 154.67162543606017

 perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and <title> robinson 	 297.4381655026071

 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock 	 123.47519221335521

 and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men 	 193.00717733858912

 <title> darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me 	 351.5119256653427

 elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well 	 469.9706740483983

 she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse 	 218.36059167007446

 and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table 	 414.7465423626899

 his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes 	 218.41214129389905

 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as <title> forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home 	 215.79845396155633

 every sister except mary agreed to go with her 	 326.4033704845463

 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom 	 362.51065285598537

 <title> bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone <title> collins began 	 68.0641863021466

 i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere 	 302.28035600468473

 you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment 	 267.5848173174466

 no no let me shift for myself 	 436.46993570378925

 they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea 	 354.97917626486213

 this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced 	 459.424344318849

 on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn 	 111.53348683946672

 and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing 	 213.52650527330056

 i am sure there is not on his  	 60.73637348064083

 he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride 	 252.64096270976478

 let wickham be your man 	 783.8873053363877

 it must be so while he retains the use of his reason 	 129.1949888896859

 i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship 	 12.442038321702919

 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you 	 216.7827836545627

 from what can it proceed 	 277.51842083427584

 any place would do of about three or four hundred a year 	 334.98386604919637

 that is my idea of good breeding 	 166.19222818354189

 such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them 	 338.40440043709367

 the indirect boast 	 281.9533906222787

 he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town 	 162.64776854397303

 she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer 	 299.76151092380115

 it was really a very handsome thought 	 106.17939012094739

 and <title> bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived 	 156.03698971559044

 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited <title> bingley and talked of <title> darcy may be guessed 	 307.805079921832

 it cannot be concealed from any one 	 85.15562385915081

 she could not but say after a moment s deliberation i am not 	 86.67003152721642

 but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day 	 274.5252033672935

 a little time therefore 	 220.98358966512288

 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley 	 323.5273023197768

 i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former 	 142.98181346023787

 i wish i could call her amiable 	 58.92185668447537

 and even when it was settled that lydia should go with <title> forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 	 67.00684945952122

 poor little lizzy but do not be cast down 	 359.8372999058177

 this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem 	 245.70889399993933

 the other is charlotte s marriage 	 278.3287491346107

 chapter xvii 	 422.2807935949913

 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph 	 831.9632728428585

 about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention 	 453.92863298697034

 if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence 	 349.8635571713514

 in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself 	 571.3397621177108

 no never 	 398.5848373205881

 they have some of the finest woods in the country 	 177.8639962715831

 no really replied elizabeth 	 631.3357564090506

 care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care 	 281.34183010426995

 and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me 	 463.4507623215602

 he is come <title> bingley is come 	 141.6168611891702

 nearly three weeks 	 2496.5604399904873

 i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection 	 155.32504919700133

 charlotte herself was tolerably composed 	 970.2058037053014

 all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating 	 639.2508062942564

 an easy distance do you call it 	 661.1926752362688

 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble 	 531.9882068551289

 his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together 	 313.3649293035305

 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 	 645.1233885456425

 i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts 	 268.5420740084303

 as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession 	 174.38925086230654

 and <title> bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign 	 300.00176767182387

 for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof 	 277.7128633736029

 <title> bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him 	 382.8215913737601

 you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered 	 136.15187064956095

 i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue 	 148.79332657519143

 i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she 	 75.57861614353888

 you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us 	 411.0918249250411

 and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 	 444.6046286566675

 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects 	 97.3266001704231

 but whatever may be the sentiments which <title> wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character 	 212.24869972188037

 during dinner <title> bennet scarcely spoke at all 	 1409.2994475446274

 lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome 	 415.5685516331737

 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here 	 477.9129348284959

 she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable 	 725.5353568333992

 but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt 	 393.71282997030863

 i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine 	 281.50639872437887

 his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing 	 680.8107819743414

 but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject 	 207.75032501824924

 while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough 	 447.32550080149423

 i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now 	 91.93775790797201

 my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past 	 345.84914266794243

 but <title> gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears 	 448.03395999224216

 but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out 	 156.90913880116887

 well well said he do not make yourself unhappy 	 210.45889648915585

 your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it 	 349.077019739056

 on being made acquainted with the present <title> darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard <title> fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy 	 374.075022992371

 said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 	 26.567788590054317

 what is it you mean 	 129.35921607434724

 and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached 	 305.4029013675019

 international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states 	 534.9759286691686

 he was resolutely silent however 	 168.03919818984977

 i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn 	 214.05036058114496

 every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that <title> long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 	 249.75942488455325

 wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him 	 281.3551218899464

 against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked 	 479.20236587414365

 oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can 	 836.4393409138706

 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here 	 400.4876699692838

 did not you 	 68.7061817851307

 she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers 	 663.3622215124769

 but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless 	 464.94992562988887

 we will be down as soon as we can said jane 	 236.58763670271819

 can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this 	 525.1527220394449

 i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away 	 569.9426384420369

 elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 	 379.7291963130846

 his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham 	 366.12290563860864

 that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling 	 469.3827748159086

 she danced four dances with him at meryton 	 570.3645401418471

 no not at all 	 116.88401154819151

 my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be 	 79.5224405250261

 he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence 	 694.9072360380717

 adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here 	 448.3827438484824

 and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together 	 304.81412071828674

 when we met at pemberley 	 607.0114331995682

 it was very little less 	 30.98176247949194

 i had much rather go in the coach 	 198.28994978600596

 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach 	 446.93569010076794

 who should do it but her own uncle 	 540.9541280284848

 and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty 	 68.4926941913282

 elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more 	 267.25249583457696

 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here 	 642.550747590275

 in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret 	 117.90600176565793

 indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother 	 509.38976523726006

 our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 	 573.086443560693

 are you quite sure ma am 	 49.215977963640945

 <initial> project gutenberg is a registered trademark 	 67.38217955999367

 nor did that day wear out her resentment 	 565.0689232979427

 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 	 183.2145912917952

 but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew <title> gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 	 199.6913828115543

 there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well 	 244.7407514921092

 and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement 	 42.269261051871304

 elizabeth could not oppose such a wish 	 46.40228753549611

 <initial> <number> through <number>  	 162.06383431404115

 i do not believe a word of it my dear 	 25.256915973173047

 oh shocking cried miss bingley 	 163.62237143203043

 has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style 	 414.0325712609578

 my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing 	 135.92864461352832

 said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with 	 218.09598414548879

 you know he is as well as i do 	 43.779176593040845

 though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here 	 446.19830013448455

 <title> gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject 	 351.7479707810976

 though we can never be what we once were to each other 	 106.33309414588322

 in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either 	 126.16606950928723

 i suppose you have heard of it 	 30.8420722699963

 it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week 	 222.6058723716873

 it was hardly enough 	 87.96136975517899

 let me do it without farther loss of time 	 145.5671457168123

 when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room 	 97.31208089051695

 for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction 	 245.63258799058661

 they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria 	 403.2073311083969

 you have a sweet room here <title> bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 	 343.96000675244346

 <title> gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone 	 228.018771498222

 they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in 	 267.63173654636415

 and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 	 203.31201917036842

 this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be 	 110.60227725545774

 on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them 	 205.5736759460708

 but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again 	 159.79048310565338

 i cannot quite agree with you there  	 315.6143023554222

 she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 	 680.2283736034545

 they have none of them much to recommend them replied he 	 200.85003316290613

 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley 	 607.08105768827

 i know very well that nothing can be done 	 22.59908015235901

 it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her 	 137.54232703582247

 she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is 	 154.73980878836716

 stay stay i will go myself 	 1001.216699217686

 oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you 	 214.12089975534607

 can there be any other opinion on the subject 	 276.37306049958056

 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge 	 321.7145305514936

 i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak 	 37.93854022505991

 this information however startled <title> bennet 	 462.48887982002583

 this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed 	 302.91861408108963

 we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home 	 537.9448354528382

 why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all 	 464.0082411779108

 nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 	 721.6783394044276

 my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way 	 149.74251753361847

 very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that  	 357.67961417384026

 i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise 	 134.8831128946225

 <title> bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation 	 123.42864510400317

 elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend 	 219.88548150133244

 causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me 	 317.0487281392713

 but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 	 250.77365777059643

 but i must write no more 	 115.91139967123657

 oh no it is not for me to be driven away by <title> darcy 	 72.21603809973726

 lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself 	 176.0624464019588

 <title> darcy smiled 	 51.884273386097455

 had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best 	 239.03977874459144

 you quite mistook <title> darcy 	 508.8291850925321

 a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 	 176.65841816994666

 every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch 	 362.998000115445

 he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security 	 413.15365848207

 poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough 	 717.5670150706021

 we have heard nothing from town 	 163.68605243407612

 well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead 	 198.69053837503046

 a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe 	 714.9937204473192

 will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties 	 417.62524742789464

 it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was 	 155.09955242639367

 she was not rendered formidable by silence 	 134.73123191477967

 it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge 	 49.51034342906874

 she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence 	 245.88901458188622

 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton 	 70.24001813986543

 believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention 	 559.0361454285633

 have you heard from my uncle 	 46.30264211897899

 we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough 	 829.2766205689715

 but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says 	 68.03048533993868

 they came 	 228.34089614641223

 our distress my dear lizzy is very great 	 545.8857029671188

 and perhaps he might be doing the same 	 363.124158450962

 nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 	 469.9260162285154

 i can remember no symptom of affection on either side 	 181.88704490201386

 <title> bennet s best comfort was that <title> bingley must be down again in the summer 	 177.87958628259364

 elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that  	 455.3021248532667

 that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 	 100.3751411045724

 however little <title> darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer 	 638.4951986942209

 his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal 	 302.97902125199016

 but from every window there were beauties to be seen 	 488.5079111128879

 her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town 	 294.6768564279061

 and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark 	 319.7661968997883

 what am i to do 	 14.90587968654505

 i could hardly keep my countenance 	 107.82322216043198

 howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by <title> collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair 	 244.48672585867754

 it was evident that he was very much in love with her 	 11.7188256706713

 and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills 	 478.758789789379

 or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more 	 338.2275416984455

 stop me whilst you can 	 1000.0

 and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief 	 358.2888320276119

 she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard 	 264.00170075704494

 how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say 	 490.4229491966132

 to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before <title> collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 	 248.3377886864161

 it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration 	 166.68564874066044

 sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before 	 478.3383827226116

 for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution 	 558.6922036235362

 and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten 	 334.67622138941175

 if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment 	 123.89123184912258

 it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 	 184.0595227233516

 you know i have 	 62.63998093781057

 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out 	 158.83280755201577

 he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask 	 341.4961096675487

 lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed 	 399.28835766448543

 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family 	 151.5753789134946

 nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family 	 219.78551783198463

 and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her 	 137.65479307474033

 we will settle with your father about the money afterwards 	 516.3747345891352

 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire 	 208.10367665601026

 he readily agreed to it 	 126.07697090598067

 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure 	 131.88322729681462

 he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter 	 151.5096111167494

 for on first hearing it <title> bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable 	 437.32427955965727

 i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us 	 50.12138967093352

 when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley 	 371.25237674306976

 you take delight in vexing me 	 476.1085874567014

 there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance 	 270.64938999521405

 it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match 	 130.72477095831275

 it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane 	 253.28534411051018

 <title> what is his name 	 82.60222608378639

 and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard 	 504.6847681796242

 <title> collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 	 412.2403040817601

 but no one looked more amused than <title> bennet himself while his wife seriously commended <title> collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man 	 257.73867988051563

 if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to <title> long 	 54.163825048578914

 <title> collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife 	 105.82620877845746

 on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks 	 284.1924673692085

 and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe 	 242.57298387019867

 he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton 	 113.31543865569053

 with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart 	 410.17334903734184

 yes there can 	 205.98377598845101

 elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 	 73.9468740330194

 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <title> bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters 	 524.2471121922008

 that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch 	 404.2379185436421

 elizabeth almost stared at her 	 510.63785783892814

 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance 	 219.16603097770323

 and she told me that it was certain true 	 34.207690335958056

 but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger 	 422.1008491765167

 she says lizzy had better have taken <title> collins 	 353.9961748931605

 while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of <title> darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room 	 346.83963417021204

 good gracious cried <title> bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable <title> darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here 	 215.37542160571206

 it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us 	 67.97733138947629

 and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt 	 785.2855244621734

 removed cried bingley 	 1000.0

 and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments 	 453.8443037467999

 and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment 	 37.43851991929961

 i hope not so 	 146.17301244399286

 aye no doubt 	 1259.202455254747

 yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken <title> darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	 185.1320545652604

 and you saw him frequently 	 110.05866250902811

 they met again on sunday and then i saw him too 	 258.11250501223435

 such i was from eight to eight and twenty 	 916.9733013076516

 but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane 	 84.75955501948069

 if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them 	 153.90764283402467

 she is my youngest girl but one 	 294.7825663149539

 in a few minutes <title> bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you 	 65.82420198130912

 it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 	 223.0743804989647

 we cannot suppose he would help it if he could 	 627.27220205844

 and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments 	 218.556832670813

 i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on 	 238.07806637911762

 <title> darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party 	 593.2552647790121

 you are very ill 	 52.65210414831082

 his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own 	 57.65167317339569

 that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter 	 217.49425147874103

 kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father 	 532.8618176397101

 you make me laugh charlotte 	 508.8291850925321

 i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton 	 26.692375289077077

 the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it 	 184.2897806445943

 let her go then 	 73.79993705551381

 in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton 	 642.7680367100385

 the surprise of such an application was great indeed 	 240.30789238104583

 but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him 	 405.18581158955783

 i rather wished than believed him to be sincere 	 138.5987607366331

 and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army 	 309.3660563978006

 i see the imprudence of it 	 127.75116317978835

 well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next 	 528.817312590987

 they are gone off together from brighton 	 204.55757266704381

 and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and <title> darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former 	 220.00608075425816

 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain 	 319.15423831194227

 i hope not 	 76.99979987562561

 one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight 	 179.28296920759055

 coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper 	 1000.0000000000013

 but you know married women have never much time for writing 	 486.53154538541105

 she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge 	 158.64130373496127

 then turning to <title> bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon 	 679.7344609899736

 but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe <title> bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent 	 371.3915027427876

 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint 	 887.9301244341997

 chapter iii 	 422.2807935949913

 sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion 	 829.9297406807319

 we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton 	 183.650933490978

 she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done 	 384.47062648081123

 no wonder if they love her better 	 768.887991531999

 come darcy said he i must have you dance 	 370.6401228183832

 elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea 	 131.5244445852433

 i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason 	 470.63333824698174

 and she could no more bear that <title> darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation 	 289.70277986870076

 do not you know that <title> collins wants to marry lizzy 	 97.65687618188558

 bingley of course returned with him to dinner 	 177.50244074236713

 she now lost every expectation of pleasure 	 281.8530622290075

 nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love 	 277.0759776330211

 and by a manoeuvre of <title> bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family 	 221.2104388417362

 he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent 	 727.3573672509281

 lydia declared herself satisfied 	 793.4419475644272

 of whom does jane ever think ill 	 943.6133468741012

 you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it 	 319.23560248693383

 chapter vii 	 422.2807935949913

 but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 	 363.465247983293

 if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better 	 165.6886085816001

 his words seemed to imply it 	 662.8419689180587

 it is impossible that he should still love me 	 78.63796773239011

 in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach 	 339.46270396023834

 i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient 	 324.95871746452866

 as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery 	 396.8429358769732

 after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it 	 299.22784014858917

 he was full of joy and attention 	 279.7189295474416

 he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her 	 200.77312066862487

 the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen 	 697.2909623267368

 sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent 	 140.12461677112248

 elizabeth was glad of it 	 30.617987713847523

 his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation 	 654.9956870304501

 or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 	 366.02807302535234

 i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country 	 135.84350435289718

 you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 	 121.38521988670499

 the first week of their return was soon gone 	 449.5673259834333

 lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself 	 489.33881296642045

 miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards 	 42.93355766023465

 and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time 	 473.5560497843559

 <title> bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together 	 120.28205613112387

 i enquired after their brother of course 	 527.4120539621304

 he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child 	 335.0880510183293

 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference 	 178.22260153965024

 elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly 	 353.42502225011054

 it was impossible not to long to know 	 21.361330149380038

 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink 	 227.11517022823494

 much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday 	 780.0534872872033

 for if i recollect right he went but the day before 	 450.57872960668533

 mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came 	 649.6169782343461

 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures 	 377.19793318473904

 i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied 	 346.39048487861965

 wickham only shook his head 	 231.5856819584847

 i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary 	 206.4134533305614

 oh but the gentlemen will have <title> bingley s chaise to go to meryton 	 248.37777090643638

 because we shall see the less of him 	 1143.2082359239382

 she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where <title> hurst had a house 	 522.365278606858

 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil 	 341.38216567603524

 it mortifies me 	 298.58135216164186

 it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 	 207.421986804792

 a lady s imagination is very rapid 	 740.5963811952507

 <title> bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation & <initial> <title> bennet was quite disconcerted 	 102.62961015851154

 and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to <title> hill and the two housemaids 	 251.67558870283557

 his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured 	 385.1406567410438

 elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 	 133.98725074725294

 if <title> darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice 	 552.9322778829911

 but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 	 99.10380607556277

 ah you do not know what i suffer 	 46.106971590038334

 said jane 	 59.03199000468261

 and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters 	 298.36910102735004

 in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective 	 356.9672478451442

 if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us 	 247.52086390418057

 you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him 	 687.0438427635061

 but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state 	 410.39391578078727

 <title> darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty 	 98.00817952592702

 i only hope they may have half my good luck 	 218.60198609616955

 his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit 	 591.4499840643244

 to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection 	 303.8693127884321

 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary 	 310.55963323227513

 and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected 	 95.50508359658592

 and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before 	 160.16893826296388

 but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies 	 250.44119946011912

 there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it 	 132.94828530387088

 but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor <title> collins were once silent 	 433.57087997722056

 <title> gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 	 336.12314110592524

 yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet 	 718.6435615665553

 one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself 	 310.56668012813566

 but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 	 193.4477315033696

 in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce 	 584.5830539718029

 you are too hasty sir she cried 	 185.94325026489156

 and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all 	 182.76771449834996

 such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing 	 209.49093150025496

 before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 	 260.0181462394813

 but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend 	 123.7534357477821

 i am grieved indeed cried darcy 	 195.86932563366065

 pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary 	 621.0972101154653

 she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 	 449.9467103020732

 as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents 	 346.4392183159074

 oh yes i understand you perfectly 	 289.8508251659594

 can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him 	 974.2777007003582

 what is it you are talking of 	 232.04357808024423

 i must have employment and society 	 120.70048939486114

 she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so 	 145.78359357298717

 there was too much to be thought 	 36.350892629191655

 and men take care that they should 	 269.63324404663405

 she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well 	 273.88631217960875

 she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 	 494.33602642793346

 and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility 	 300.98855596907845

 on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think <title> darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton 	 268.4129378902557

 this is a parade cried he which does one good 	 293.560966099136

 and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon 	 216.98961498529124

 that is very strange 	 38.67601963771707

 oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he 	 807.0888385429397

 but i dare say he may spend half his time here 	 85.9974143609259

 and she spoke very little except in a low voice to <title> jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes 	 222.4957153312436

 there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome 	 473.1446632630518

 she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 	 95.34534572335713

 elizabeth was now to see <title> wickham for the last time 	 99.29485136009173

 good bye 	 773.6161009266046

 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations 	 130.97532518673898

 it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november <title> darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to <title> bingley to see you all after him so soon 	 212.5826885548303

 i never can be thankful <title> bennet for any thing about the entail 	 198.4798913464357

 <title> bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could 	 211.64456264931607

 when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel 	 74.99187545893251

 she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin 	 141.42776705444322

 <initial> <number> with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg tm license 	 25.30195917415601

 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield 	 306.4069535314079

 while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 	 472.8920585846928

 and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door 	 124.73127720664243

 miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural 	 407.21583002178477

 two obstacles of the five being thus removed <title> bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them 	 1026.5019695829176

 they may wish many things besides his happiness 	 225.8910763475323

 <title> collins was gratified 	 31.586797840262584

 and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 	 266.51136154048476

 oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt 	 129.75888280453177

 elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered 	 572.9059444735668

 and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room 	 112.41588914131208

 if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable 	 251.84236883913636

 i described and enforced them earnestly 	 474.06918491998107

 her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh 	 309.23292399025104

 jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 	 521.3496268638771

 oh how acutely did she now feel it 	 764.9828109193575

 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded 	 500.90604407847195

 there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming 	 319.7877199399527

 believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections 	 281.58906385854704

 really <title> collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly 	 357.28429403944756

 indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them 	 271.5951006389743

 it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 	 365.116294566965

 i dislike it very much he replied 	 527.4120539621304

 elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 	 657.0079594806257

 if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him 	 164.92299050020787

 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him 	 96.76881480838719

 not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did <title> bennet give up the point 	 115.03722225231972

 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure 	 218.1518061338482

 they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it 	 369.60443251315894

 lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations 	 617.190208140167

 at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood 	 637.6063374751452

 and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin 	 277.6732865871993

 she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents 	 278.5492072987979

 for mine is totally different 	 598.7637891259209

 but georgiana would not join her 	 474.37817361925147

 if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy 	 452.8507387599673

 for though i am the youngest i m the tallest 	 129.79271339589656

 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew 	 138.2189340384966

 elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself 	 343.7046130256993

 though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question 	 401.9968281161036

 if he fears me why come hither 	 343.481807062629

 elizabeth asked questions in vain 	 510.63785783892814

 the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings 	 264.2997059153432

 and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too 	 375.45739804828463

 the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions 	 188.20219483441855

 what say you mary 	 102.54931179226182

 their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush 	 454.0341537791914

 their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them 	 365.69794624705145

 she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property 	 393.8585744009774

 and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side 	 358.12642872579073

 and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 	 419.8342819924594

 how good it was in you my dear <title> bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last 	 250.9557805815559

 <initial> <number>  	 26.26468639256898

 but this would be nothing if you really liked him 	 397.44633973267634

 then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce <title> bingley to her  	 139.36955390575002

 and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it 	 147.82939119451402

 allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place 	 264.4265439353379

 how <title> darcy looked therefore she could not tell 	 270.22532768422315

 do you know <title> bingley 	 101.84332885838057

 my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can not write 	 53.00402459257439

 it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth 	 170.38472640227414

 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired 	 515.5746227967004

 when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of <title> darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small 	 341.3571872077263

 what a pity it is mamma we did not all go 	 511.6468702908945

 <title> darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to <title> collins 	 56.030332502572264

 the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves 	 383.7355586564244

 it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family 	 186.67545786618402

 i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment 	 276.55828458386407

 i would go and see her if i could have the carriage 	 100.20875087784044

 her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted 	 314.7065783909332

 you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine 	 262.2342434274465

 and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much 	 489.8756378073682

 my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better 	 308.98324227639006

 chapter ix 	 422.2807935949913

 lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty 	 604.8405227949335

 it was all over before i arrived 	 154.54445289295526

 but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them 	 146.68015241336488

 widely different was the effect of a second perusal 	 256.1657586178799

 but it is all all too late now 	 110.69209244666196

 caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one 	 1228.0356493975466

 not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night 	 506.9299526284979

 limited warranty disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph <number>  	 97.03984039343754

 elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 	 575.441022612888

 its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned 	 1000.5808656214908

 on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid 	 213.20322303471738

 yes or i will never see her again 	 170.94613531029975

 <title> bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly 	 116.18985421596086

 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park 	 137.78756484671922

 chapter xvii 	 422.2807935949913

 sure he will not leave london before he has found them 	 398.13436953982307

 for of course they were to have a son 	 150.3559627498403

 i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns 	 270.2909525320246

 not the slightest 	 655.5361981874374

 people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 	 553.0621564273939

 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of <title> darcy 	 350.6574803941165

 my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging 	 180.12559625114883

 can i have the carriage 	 95.67399201599407

 on both sides it was only assertion 	 219.46673751546277

 oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing 	 392.4580211632943

 and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted 	 196.26857487490742

 but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible 	 239.50926938936476

 i cannot believe it 	 64.85837379076285

 the agitations of former partiality entirely so 	 581.2483181145896

 he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on 	 182.99920732702066

 they were ignorant idle and vain 	 75.35628351112103

 i am sure i know none so handsome 	 42.54962457298755

 you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so 	 83.2221926280983

 upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 	 434.1787500751478

 but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure 	 202.60409689846944

 you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by e mail within <number> days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg tm license 	 84.59962637237956

 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman 	 115.14146311196295

 chapter <initial> miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt 	 76.13006686358042

 you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin 	 455.3488228158243

 but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself 	 176.15257232711292

 in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him 	 428.10374672678194

 you must not suspect me 	 73.56677913983965

 and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large 	 200.92115107115495

 you may depend upon my not mentioning it 	 28.59932036424278

 lizzy you must not do so 	 40.4217632728454

 but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life 	 229.0356924041221

 as soon as ever <title> bingley comes my dear said <title> bennet you will wait on him of course 	 90.47988368533146

 there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner 	 303.3781548143574

 not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks 	 98.59892638668325

 and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 	 582.5269018850751

 i will go directly to <title> bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure 	 98.49280346209784

 let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance 	 463.882502798852

 but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations 	 357.59130048542676

 the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock 	 256.6815231905712

 and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit 	 465.92468029405376

 with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many 	 434.5006385314473

 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her 	 190.6484779012644

 i cannot think of it without abhorrence 	 94.81894688931307

 lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 	 340.02994185149123

 wickham will soon be gone 	 99.53679526437337

 but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done 	 62.61266742420322

 i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows 	 228.09803260798094

 charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 	 97.87827048563109

 elizabeth went away with her head full of him 	 688.3995231936632

 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony 	 659.4815125571

 their parties abroad were less varied than before 	 809.2591685117668

 <title> and <title> gardiner smiled 	 29.09434785116998

 she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged 	 400.2173974953007

 but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded 	 130.27409008379476

 they are my old friends 	 197.8293965165951

 yes my youngest is not sixteen 	 754.136865060387

 neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight 	 539.5544482938067

 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen 	 457.23052599437375

 in spite of having been at st 	 82.8824910104437

 she went on 	 272.1738493982046

 miss bennet i insist on being satisfied 	 196.594706409524

 you are safe from me 	 183.992437935808

 but i do not think there would have been any fun in it 	 78.69089168549783

 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth 	 224.00053043884418

 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much 	 533.1072348889412

 his character is thereby complete 	 298.4984161509344

 his character sunk on every review of it 	 83.5292860595846

 but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well 	 387.28071907569165

 this was not very consoling to <title> bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate 	 173.14362825485503

 miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room 	 210.29572979127883

 and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am 	 167.71508885286468

 but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear 	 66.04000980877674

 give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey 	 322.7475759654938

 i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london 	 197.1849541979206

 a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago 	 469.02766035504715

 james s 	 48.69206537895697

 her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained 	 414.4317904634959

 blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 	 575.0753043874458

 how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer 	 475.1183438778873

 pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit 	 582.421789820197

 but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit 	 148.09638513435746

 it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her 	 339.87852777249816

 there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works 	 66.84503568528035

 you are rather disposed to call his interference officious 	 390.4411120664592

 he wrote last week to hurry my return 	 566.5747253395249

 <title> philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance 	 322.7530961064312

 and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do 	 84.4540770259014

 it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement 	 100.64155589320858

 he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world 	 300.8813966341933

 and <title> collins was to attend them at the request of <title> bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself 	 71.60346846261879

 it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it 	 168.5383363436494

 the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving 	 681.5004025714246

 he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house 	 209.72762108224333

 jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 	 229.46470338966066

 and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way 	 205.86936819952055

 he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam 	 364.1737435227245

 my style of writing is very different from yours 	 411.1778276287576

 she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning 	 221.44749988183463

 or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good 	 734.5692641674954

 and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid 	 355.68650823810225

 invented by <subscript> bell <number> charlotte street bedford square 	 1000.0

 she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it 	 182.0003330537395

 <title> hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently <title> darcy s eyes were fixed on her 	 195.41035320795328

 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world 	 505.94367109829074

 and have you answered the letter 	 166.1372593669405

 we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice 	 479.01874473978444

 for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman 	 378.5029682077951

 but it pleased her 	 118.03610326736634

 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea 	 198.74239924083489

 how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 	 290.18796232669945

 i never thought <title> darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 	 125.3240954961695

 but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into 	 141.6227583408675

 and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject 	 327.40458992474373

 chapter xv 	 422.2807935949913

 her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved 	 649.3669777055877

 not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 	 834.4466516451531

 you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir 	 687.0438427635061

 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth 	 160.9089505306428

 elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 	 618.7415665145747

 i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled 	 201.30306300116567

 and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books 	 383.9478509618312

 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects 	 312.6030726469451

 you do not look well 	 74.73071637052585

 and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office 	 367.2469606017645

 whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable 	 1060.3751039335273

 but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it 	 80.47584756075993

 she did indeed 	 44.40018937829197

 to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew 	 885.802053586811

 in which case you may be sure of my pardon 	 395.37996997902343

 of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt 	 556.3299520672265

 and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances 	 457.025647146624

 and <title> hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet 	 355.90162782150685

 nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation 	 964.7390266048988

 the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great 	 203.87216875696308

 and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself 	 263.1932064861173

 but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know 	 111.4110339033881

 and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest 	 334.73508654749634

 human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 	 366.0240510688756

 darcy said nothing at all 	 231.5856819584847

 i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 	 458.85294823371754

 the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified 	 385.15483614100873

 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure 	 231.31294046339465

 and at length by repeated assurances that <title> darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match 	 383.9451163437392

 darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence 	 910.049858638854

 <title> darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 	 267.35730761503515

 but what does he say of the living 	 78.8426640648257

 not equal to lydia s for him 	 325.5245228929039

 the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment 	 43.96094998102526

 send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly 	 346.38655060456955

 we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia 	 153.73983363527913

 while sir william was with them <title> collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country 	 384.20498382468065

 a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented 	 476.0468288876716

 when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him 	 534.2349425604968

 but the things should be ordered immediately 	 310.0352352926995

 this will not do said elizabeth 	 218.58443626623134

 you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner 	 488.58233438944774

 what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual 	 465.83118710216246

 james <initial> as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park 	 338.8474011292192

 and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year 	 236.13873163683527

 he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards <title> darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm 	 142.91796093880083

 oh my dear <title> bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball 	 67.6536025123275

 <title> bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears 	 246.4081902867642

 my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day 	 207.2947048229515

 she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility 	 150.87491852544633

 she felt it so 	 59.465851789290284

 i know it cannot be long 	 20.45996663486115

 these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce 	 677.4202087106326

 only this 	 1002.325487699245

 and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way 	 361.97208903470516

 could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected 	 89.94272797958239

 my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this 	 682.0715578211606

 i am going away myself 	 82.44988628144598

 she had gained her point and had time to consider of it 	 246.12033037059146

 lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with <title> darcy 	 455.8120573256372

 he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it 	 91.26131211937862

 he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits 	 160.85427651449632

 you are mistaken 	 16.30519370845066

 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie 	 358.4796140123327

 maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder 	 139.03100307535752

 i know not miss elizabeth said he whether <title> collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 	 275.3257192492926

 if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go 	 473.2957637780693

 and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite 	 586.8036992355228

 that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance 	 131.65830574245675

 oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable 	 276.9379089239316

 i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 	 401.1995211561495

 but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels 	 454.7351614501081

 nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair 	 488.0666494546477

 that you certainly shall 	 246.66726948544314

 elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to <title> darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it 	 186.51162897981106

 how could you begin 	 53.51710934981262

 darcy took up a book 	 921.9592058519438

 oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty 	 433.0952083011678

 but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement 	 64.49013903888485

 but no one was less likely than <title> bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 	 159.96573621082828

 and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 	 324.31031419002335

 i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way 	 66.87802518133516

 your first position is false 	 681.360213151587

 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks 	 183.3747043162168

 and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with <title> wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in <title> darcy s looks and behaviour 	 87.4993404235705

 five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on <title> bennet and the children 	 181.14429885075262

 this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place 	 350.32650533585115

 but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them 	 358.60984947877745

 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there  	 857.8673298818773

 my fingers wait your orders 	 398.8356038874161

 that it ought not to be attempted 	 63.04873538532606

 happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 	 464.15888336127796

 yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say <title> darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable 	 634.4947987687601

 jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay 	 170.8143810515492

 to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth 	 541.7711788299848

 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost 	 510.8590934691661

 certainly not 	 1413.003842087282

 <title> wickham s attention was caught 	 42.82770118235174

 he leaves out half his words and blots the rest 	 694.9072360380717

 lydia was exceedingly fond of him 	 325.96157072949507

 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way 	 127.20441289778697

 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy 	 29.369135000910507

 but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book 	 583.3569844787843

 i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation 	 653.8509742228716

 but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had 	 150.39337687097378

 i am glad he dines here on tuesday 	 105.50632615762497

 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 	 152.98695944812167

 for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to <title> darcy were by no means over 	 207.03934204305006

 what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side 	 516.5818841953295

 as she pronounced these words <title> darcy changed colour 	 501.8487441557766

 the distance is nothing when one has a motive 	 655.7310879005631

 and above all things keep <title> bennet from fighting 	 292.9830030166743

 pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us 	 1039.1604124796625

 it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them 	 262.4995084692235

 her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself 	 222.6414676312993

 for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible 	 634.1500792585273

 oh why is not every body as happy 	 764.9828109193575

 i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 	 110.79134360876063

 she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address 	 324.40706019639754

 i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew <title> darcy 	 335.0245920620439

 are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted 	 613.4012158651735

 consider how important every moment is in such a case 	 526.2083268228114

 but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy 	 278.0465272049602

 or me either for that matter 	 934.5296559087665

 that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer 	 455.60824610203633

 on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away 	 90.18494143748839

 but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up 	 445.52314154406974

 as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done 	 99.73477600637679

 <title> darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he 	 147.01710005380627

 she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between <title> darcy and herself 	 369.4612913613823

 and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance 	 208.10519044392765
