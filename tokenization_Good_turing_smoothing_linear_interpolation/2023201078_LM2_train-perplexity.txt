 chapter <initial> it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife 	18.605438100321116

 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters 	14.565220064171411

 my dear <title> bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last 	13.122210764565054

 for <title> long has just been here and she told me all about it 	19.9665569780008

 <title> bennet made no answer 	22.4530642702986

 do not you want to know who has taken it 	25.94793074636788

 this was invitation enough 	41.2537166496516

 that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with <title> morris immediately 	15.9268923977586

 that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 	18.170932862391275

 what is his name 	44.69495626921667

 is he married or single 	22.361444980165047

 is that his design in settling here 	24.735180310384553

 i see no occasion for that 	23.923032245771818

 you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them <title> bingley might like you the best of the party 	16.099801852903376

 my dear you flatter me 	24.597025075333914

 i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now 	18.78672720830268

 when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 	16.21976561877069

 in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of 	15.14008862783175

 but my dear you must indeed go and see <title> bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 	21.83180565807436

 it is more than i engage for i assure you 	18.921457339950273

 sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers 	13.251912678743633

 indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not 	17.38014405965616

 you are over scrupulous surely 	22.353328777814877

 i dare say <title> bingley will be very glad to see you 	19.14109720398387

 though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy 	29.466267414336777

 i desire you will do no such thing 	25.983092968754676

 lizzy is not a bit better than the others 	28.01852901417637

 and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia 	14.45299930843266

 they are all silly and ignorant like other girls 	14.359626518349957

 but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 	17.342845708514133

 <title> bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way 	14.567141555394354

 you take delight in vexing me 	20.441759117383945

 you have no compassion on my poor nerves 	23.872477404958275

 i have a high respect for your nerves 	26.986296646392006

 they are my old friends 	26.80897489367849

 i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least 	11.558832621593517

 ah you do not know what i suffer 	32.0118152949516

 but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 	13.047444307509513

 it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them 	14.508754925970978

 depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all 	20.080180127603356

 <title> bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character 	9.300518857347697

 her mind was less difficult to develope 	22.631982326285826

 she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper 	12.420946787569514

 its solace was visiting and news 	13.54514809885275

 <title> bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on <title> bingley 	13.808847781093279

 he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go 	18.69442013346007

 and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it 	19.416658306692213

 it was then disclosed in the following manner 	26.426849512169095

 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope <title> bingley will like it lizzy 	11.843390948521876

 but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that <title> long has promised to introduce him 	17.916806028424038

 i do not believe <title> long will do any such thing 	20.473907428023754

 she has two nieces of her own 	25.317005960750993

 she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her 	18.220582557129458

 no more have i said <title> bennet 	23.97372881981088

 and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 	19.912874422846247

 <title> bennet deigned not to make any reply 	25.536762700633926

 do not keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves 	12.68246035932768

 you tear them to pieces 	42.06928752270401

 kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father 	19.836402334810924

 she times them ill 	40.70778267323073

 i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully 	15.073397024847363

 when is your next ball to be lizzy 	36.57086601770846

 to morrow fortnight 	67.22069559259651

 aye so it is cried her mother and <title> long does not come back till the day before 	22.798850979279152

 so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself 	25.736138986360814

 impossible <title> bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself 	24.603786687110365

 how can you be so teazing 	46.31212910462067

 i honour your circumspection 	42.61937642263917

 one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight 	26.329817369471993

 but if we do not venture somebody else will 	22.72234990354941

 and after all <title> long and her nieces must stand their chance 	18.33115403502617

 and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself 	16.51525776568961

 the girls stared at their father 	26.984838124449205

 <title> bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation 	13.042476633631948

 cried he 	180.10217835786398

 do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense 	15.466658786676867

 i cannot quite agree with you there  	27.362769610523255

 what say you mary 	55.82128053656356

 for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts 	13.874026291030384

 mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how 	20.043047448047158

 while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to <title> bingley 	12.76273114484891

 i am sick of <title> bingley cried his wife 	20.543468923822545

 i am sorry to hear that  	24.80333470613013

 but why did not you tell me so before 	30.284988153170946

 if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him 	20.96462245308196

 it is very unlucky 	42.75543594068167

 but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now 	19.56214464581894

 the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished 	26.33135596419257

 that of <title> bennet perhaps surpassing the rest 	19.9311864720115

 though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while 	19.945233311194816

 how good it was in you my dear <title> bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last 	21.535186247963267

 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance 	13.938207512530582

 well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now 	15.787563887134787

 now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said <title> bennet 	14.241095736227264

 and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife 	20.84621184363125

 what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut 	20.982300401273342

 i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness 	19.37479762674441

 at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day 	17.521669055423974

 but for your sakes we would do any thing 	19.594121647116488

 lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say <title> bingley will dance with you at the next ball 	17.894759792191547

 for though i am the youngest i m the tallest 	14.048699125163777

 chapter iii 	389.700158465448

 not all that <title> bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of <title> bingley 	14.522939412536262

 they attacked him in various ways 	28.46395454479014

 but he eluded the skill of them all 	16.24855385743558

 her report was highly favourable 	24.570527831983366

 sir william had been delighted with him 	32.04844614070753

 he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 	14.03908581132916

 nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love 	18.07106882166626

 and very lively hopes of <title> bingley s heart were entertained 	19.636094625310974

 if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said <title> bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for 	16.79591169047804

 he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much 	18.456841672321936

 but he saw only the father 	28.164469833509767

 the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 	8.078071604349102

 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched 	25.358813520909944

 and already had <title> bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all 	11.91293841183151

 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire 	16.247129270818096

 and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be 	13.421417533276689

 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball 	13.949997358767517

 and a report soon followed that <title> bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly 	15.309865173482128

 the girls grieved over such a number of ladies 	20.067772400412522

 but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin 	13.822231707923937

 and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether 	12.949047170979982

 <title> bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man 	15.121776465206043

 <title> bingley was good looking and gentleman like 	18.95605107531788

 he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners 	16.34692965625234

 his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion 	13.560191776816964

 his brother in law <title> hurst merely looked the gentleman 	14.419557535594894

 but his friend <title> darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien 	13.816526749277587

 and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year 	15.118521956610754

 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than <title> bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity 	13.99515432489071

 for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased 	19.44099664619808

 and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend 	11.940127199013146

 <title> bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room 	16.677142193290056

 he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield 	10.225862859547886

 such amiable qualities must speak for themselves 	17.491330471740792

 what a contrast between him and his friend <title> darcy danced only once with <title> hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party 	13.118548870490496

 his character was decided 	43.66603672710085

 he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again 	16.202874070435872

 amongst the most violent against him was <title> bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters 	15.990792872956451

 come darcy said he i must have you dance 	32.82953276405245

 you had much better dance 	52.73188286961299

 i certainly shall not 	48.51284666751394

 you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner 	17.08095074056254

 at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable 	24.96185770382181

 your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with 	17.04625400335703

 i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening 	16.07121915905843

 and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 	20.673849362506274

 you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said <title> darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet 	21.386634894120284

 oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable 	14.959434563286337

 which do you mean 	33.38665205643893

 and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable 	11.954822314122733

 but not handsome enough to tempt me  	26.087971905169773

 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me 	13.782113223579477

 <title> bingley followed his advice 	33.14908826064646

 and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 	16.302488164534918

 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends 	17.975359214713123

 the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family 	17.910632403358683

 <title> bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party 	18.1920367687156

 <title> bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters 	19.845907795591323

 jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way 	24.229459692040006

 elizabeth felt jane s pleasure 	53.023236571198396

 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood 	20.35228383024413

 and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 	17.29756738355606

 they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants 	18.17956244177328

 they found <title> bennet still up 	41.09227682317868

 and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations 	17.288207796547997

 he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed 	22.39859472974915

 but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear 	22.394044920589

 oh my dear <title> bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball 	19.151053524165974

 i wish you had been there 	34.814178590835866

 jane was so admired nothing could be like it 	25.956845023765357

 and <title> bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice 	17.514202209302937

 only think of that my dear 	41.460450493585356

 and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time 	20.01175735118651

 first of all he asked miss lucas 	25.493853217819563

 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her 	17.78476312640495

 and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance 	21.50463649928315

 so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next 	15.982335540292556

 i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses 	15.285080844515086

 i dare say the lace upon <title> hurst s gown here she was interrupted again 	11.999594791742052

 <title> bennet protested against any description of finery 	15.186991742149429

 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of <title> darcy 	8.593638339037998

 but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy 	12.364956379848735

 for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing 	15.980042598169543

 so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs 	14.232750019189288

 i quite detest the man 	23.642049606000473

 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of <title> bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him 	17.06810649479799

 and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can 	14.638670256374592

 i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time 	21.388599991803098

 i did not expect such a compliment 	32.19832385187896

 did not you 	63.93721844500363

 i did for you 	51.07066906449768

 but that is one great difference between us 	22.96062138231614

 what could be more natural than his asking you again 	19.95362541997339

 he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room 	12.364863088936197

 no thanks to his gallantry for that 	30.392059018585414

 well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him 	26.009478930253735

 you have liked many a stupider person 	18.356084161144732

 dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general 	15.831731752160719

 you never see a fault in any body 	23.508461828099385

 all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes 	22.3282255128381

 i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one 	15.597652663418863

 i know you do 	44.31266509463154

 and it is that which makes the wonder 	17.665168200479258

 with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough 	11.044941149974145

 one meets it every where 	22.410709017134433

 and so you like this man s sisters too do you 	14.276182826761097

 certainly not 	202.3300737942246

 at first 	138.11757937697914

 but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them 	20.262926760658658

 miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house 	24.083009193284134

 and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her 	15.537683944376777

 elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced 	33.089255177193095

 their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general 	18.99701723653782

 and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them 	12.608028110999584

 they were in fact very fine ladies 	26.52852300331746

 not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it 	15.982913794886235

 but proud and conceited 	55.77038326862743

 they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank 	11.436459331322082

 and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others 	13.299761761877795

 a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade 	13.048744296011535

 <title> bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it 	12.40454496937839

 <title> bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county 	17.28094040627573

 but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase 	15.371039602169843

 but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was <title> hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her 	12.549570002019586

 <title> bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house 	13.69308587528828

 he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately 	16.526167625802277

 bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied 	12.26007132491203

 in understanding darcy was the superior 	39.140183617919355

 bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever 	18.145718734955885

 he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting 	12.450128392109708

 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 	17.044092825573202

 bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence 	14.02707552371874

 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic 	17.20085818455443

 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life 	14.60137535200937

 every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room 	15.168851109279473

 and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 	18.07253000675943

 darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure 	11.47352688431898

 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much 	21.21272630919739

 <title> hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of 	14.66405133246084

 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose 	16.512141380728792

 the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly 	11.789058817499035

 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town 	20.750273794484066

 for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious 	14.33481583344731

 on the contrary he was all attention to every body 	25.209467159000486

 by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st 	8.251502583492982

 james s had made him courteous 	36.9333416163282

 they had several children 	51.0725620089049

 the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend 	13.544885811299205

 that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary 	14.585383307690874

 and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate 	21.499029192369473

 you began the evening well charlotte said <title> bennet with civil self command to miss lucas 	13.672393225112463

 you were <title> bingley s first choice 	34.650704507893614

 but he seemed to like his second better 	31.1543372583108

 oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice 	24.593802038642295

 to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about <title> robinson 	13.622433118233173

 perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and <title> robinson 	26.70340602029978

 did not i mention it to you 	29.618189218292713

 <title> robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest 	13.846620712988189

 upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know 	13.57597591822054

 my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte 	15.23566763873363

 <title> darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he 	19.493062857055495

 poor eliza to be only just tolerable  	35.459586174529704

 i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment 	17.461233918081003

 for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him 	19.90818980693623

 <title> long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips 	14.767298091345463

 is not there a little mistake 	36.74281521757759

 i certainly saw <title> darcy speaking to her 	25.697226171284047

 aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her 	19.869052457373748

 but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to 	18.921872678959108

 miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance 	14.601217802874595

 if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to <title> long 	24.970574056765038

 but i can guess how it was 	21.21830244073507

 every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that <title> long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 	17.466539510827253

 i do not mind his not talking to <title> long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza 	18.3072023346218

 another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you 	19.945801816781042

 i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him 	15.45594363100263

 one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself 	13.133033511310265

 if i may so express it he has a right to be proud 	22.57147235175408

 that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine  	18.514985682246227

 by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary 	12.009005369141606

 vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously 	11.932326307584544

 a person may be proud without being vain 	27.80427125914362

 pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us 	16.93935582947226

 if i were as rich as <title> darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was 	14.827722187705714

 then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said <title> bennet 	17.002027919292466

 the boy protested that she should not 	21.200037988198257

 she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit 	21.25280381037347

 chapter vi 	389.700158465448

 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield 	17.116514803790025

 the visit was returned in due form 	17.524274230857472

 miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of <title> hurst and miss bingley 	16.040467468612537

 and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest 	17.28852296614974

 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure 	21.324817665754683

 but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them 	14.658592435992086

 though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration 	16.520203846091647

 it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her 	17.672542231923966

 and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love 	20.41180363552252

 but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent 	13.957346118944916

 she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas 	30.68695881016699

 it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case 	16.79217899127159

 but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 	23.777876882462106

 if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him 	16.87982508705372

 and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark 	21.403303954301293

 there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself 	13.84109990653321

 we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough 	12.38798837245646

 but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement 	17.9839065462946

 in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels 	12.71345424604474

 but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on 	18.677284958918765

 but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow 	20.016589297477356

 if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too 	17.043600997684454

 remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do 	21.133317618976474

 but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out 	17.701217044853465

 perhaps he must if he sees enough of her 	27.369728971511368

 but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together 	15.669346134912383

 and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together 	13.165675732566667

 your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married 	18.029926931819983

 and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it 	13.767895057904163

 but these are not jane s feelings 	45.19309814122624

 she is not acting by design 	25.70984054070851

 as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness 	20.72324454946354

 she has known him only a fortnight 	30.433297686306013

 she danced four dances with him at meryton 	24.478728159247346

 she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times 	15.33680567057582

 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character 	19.969161534676953

 not as you represent it 	29.466037955011767

 had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite 	17.549675354630054

 but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal 	11.250141131352036

 these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce 	10.764444508374483

 well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart 	18.292351115069074

 and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth 	18.5006950219427

 happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 	13.31842077847025

 they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation 	11.047073206342773

 and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life 	20.78205542993326

 you make me laugh charlotte 	32.11706331395433

 but it is not sound 	42.1389774715395

 you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself 	23.285294120776026

 occupied in observing <title> bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend 	17.620834498418642

 <title> darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty 	24.047879233794266

 he had looked at her without admiration at the ball 	26.80177458457228

 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes 	15.56005360575856

 to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying 	13.501187318424474

 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing 	12.858188578313754

 of this she was perfectly unaware 	43.41103829404339

 to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with 	15.56648608387003

 he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others 	23.078480951390297

 his doing so drew her notice 	16.152628192711592

 it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled 	15.788284047078081

 what does <title> darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster 	17.59045640053587

 but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about 	21.939616324394265

 he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him 	12.464981988600998

 on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think <title> darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton 	13.670396936214606

 with great energy 	102.93240761429963

 but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic 	18.158612505440356

 it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas 	18.85128013728542

 i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows 	18.38126707779114

 you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers 	11.788083336459797

 on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well 	17.61831379966689

 if it must be so it must 	41.23362681253354

 and gravely glancing at <title> darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song 	9.37909120438978

 her performance was pleasing though by no means capital 	13.365575231659252

 after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display 	12.291276884103313

 mary had neither genius nor taste 	20.131561542151562

 and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached 	10.420084559441355

 elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well 	15.111693488698206

 and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room 	10.19972494780078

 <title> darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began 	12.406167176646594

 i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies 	18.34010702277502

 certainly sir 	319.32638774115844

 and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world 	13.148698400078667

 every savage can dance 	26.201044141710824

 sir william only smiled 	39.96080256727502

 your friend performs delightfully 	34.59673232234928

 he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group 	15.98258925953229

 and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself <title> darcy 	15.492202507571958

 you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir 	22.3835481076984

 yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight 	17.06566213349709

 do you often dance at st 	24.69599788093283

 james s 	390.9404065754777

 never sir 	171.44914662121008

 do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place 	26.108352821141253

 you have a house in town i conclude 	27.24317086592329

 <title> darcy bowed 	100.90987431041184

 i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society 	15.339561190656587

 but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas 	15.232741836556261

 he paused in hopes of an answer 	27.163949456212762

 but his companion was not disposed to make any 	30.25675778073774

 and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing 	14.096539878691429

 <title> darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 	20.77696345017593

 you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you 	14.716217207431383

 and taking her hand he would have given it to <title> darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing 	14.803807331639499

 i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner 	17.770506816453032

 <title> darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand 	17.278651859674355

 but in vain 	69.96409429081

 elizabeth was determined 	84.07438814438655

 nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 	16.04047283007955

 you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you 	17.670627195276708

 and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour 	10.533685223546897

 <title> darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling 	26.759060685302426

 he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance 	13.719331138843947

 for who would object to such a partner 	36.364639227397085

 elizabeth looked archly and turned away 	17.64435689358062

 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie 	17.433582512168066

 i should imagine not 	46.803353285512216

 you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society 	14.32893316398917

 and indeed i am quite of your opinion 	36.08734390086499

 i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise 	11.624252990361759

 the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you 	8.749424092984645

 my mind was more agreeably engaged 	30.96528949923678

 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow 	15.838895345837747

 miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 	12.458933686691077

 miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley 	21.84445160239163

 how long has she been such a favourite 	37.39506748478926

 and pray when am i to wish you joy 	19.37094093095004

 that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask 	19.421910752688195

 a lady s imagination is very rapid 	28.385737866324362

 it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment 	11.862467923404221

 i knew you would be wishing me joy 	27.388165386523944

 nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled 	20.815308989582007

 you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you 	19.140041580513724

 he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long 	14.286902999558937

 <title> bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation 	7.668059829063859

 and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his 	11.290287651053944

 her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds 	13.815691244860796

 she had a sister married to a <title> philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 	16.62725103231588

 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton 	18.870708318272992

 a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way 	10.863497029426972

 the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions 	16.417639820272594

 their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening 	9.319857604960283

 and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt 	12.57736223782575

 at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood 	14.263415033261666

 it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters 	21.126379715308943

 their visits to <title> philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence 	21.13008398939536

 every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections 	19.625059028214032

 their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves 	18.30973618660577

 <title> philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before 	14.136479053023562

 they could talk of nothing but officers 	36.94210460691337

 and <title> bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign 	13.587641503741807

 i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced 	20.133600927782517

 catherine was disconcerted and made no answer 	14.088176481349395

 but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london 	14.774762792264458

 i am astonished my dear said <title> bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 	17.920918905086875

 if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however 	21.341028575764373

 yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever 	25.83239475342334

 this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree 	20.165488105917174

 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish 	13.132145223513776

 my dear <title> bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother 	17.806260496012843

 when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 	14.468764599959206

 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart 	14.167178327173254

 and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him 	9.832099264817892

 and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals 	15.89682330987086

 mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came 	14.032379734164202

 she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library 	11.553533077839043

 <title> bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet 	14.811975869264748

 it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer 	22.305571901282416

 <title> bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from 	13.284783718595598

 what is it about 	60.78923148036279

 make haste my love 	24.658530973132102

 it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud 	24.26331263068375

 come as soon as you can on the receipt of this 	23.945623688676953

 yours ever caroline bingley 	42.48259898711984

 with the officers cried lydia 	40.9120947427572

 i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that  	25.96339974635614

 dining out said <title> bennet that is very unlucky 	26.516715449013358

 can i have the carriage 	49.0527633264467

 no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain 	15.818076001766771

 and then you must stay all night 	26.66914022593557

 that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home 	22.259726600202928

 and the hursts have no horses to theirs 	17.67253389690256

 i had much rather go in the coach 	29.065650094419233

 but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure 	14.73587330585556

 they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them 	19.066249182909957

 but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered 	25.478446595632793

 she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged 	18.38550316693447

 jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day 	16.126101717499516

 her hopes were answered 	35.85987206099816

 jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 	17.562526803935015

 her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted 	26.946122425078702

 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission 	18.715799758438617

 this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said <title> bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own 	14.785178843514437

 till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 	26.487684994015318

 breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday 	11.44540496489727

 they insist also on my seeing <title> jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me 	12.6844184995046

 yours & <initial> well my dear said <title> bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of <title> bingley and under your orders 	13.286821052027816

 oh i am not at all afraid of her dying 	41.82693452211987

 people do not die of little trifling colds 	21.76332217770494

 she will be taken good care of 	22.664513455290933

 as long as she stays there it is all very well 	19.839887433977655

 i would go and see her if i could have the carriage 	29.591381627437457

 elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had 	20.54047358363277

 she declared her resolution 	45.548893144169014

 i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want 	19.129967320690913

 is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses 	20.056642988962967

 no indeed 	184.11355954083083

 i do not wish to avoid the walk 	22.349366039607204

 the distance is nothing when one has a motive 	17.539661262666787

 only three miles 	53.67190390881584

 i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason 	10.924477892137554

 and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required 	19.79038615968254

 we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia 	16.983101408328423

 elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together 	20.736026278137118

 if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes 	11.767052747463243

 in meryton they parted 	44.02114020760931

 the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 	7.731355649016187

 she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise 	11.24450658878594

 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to <title> hurst and miss bingley 	12.996932103031286

 and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it 	18.80867482822188

 she was received however very politely by them 	14.71878933218093

 and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness 	23.440704305783843

 there was good humour and kindness 	33.93457083056243

 <title> darcy said very little and <title> hurst nothing at all 	20.48179987541345

 the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 	29.266800834407153

 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered 	25.119901705566658

 elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately 	39.83036769639194

 she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with 	13.452022040180548

 when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters 	30.331844056390675

 and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane 	15.08371902064257

 the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it 	12.914919980059018

 advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts 	22.252822650981113

 the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely 	12.698567633350471

 elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent 	19.100325362545078

 the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere 	19.118956798174036

 when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go 	17.97882456779421

 and very unwillingly said so 	26.183138686622737

 miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 	13.0603184593187

 elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes 	10.30683189340138

 chapter viii 	389.700158465448

 at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 	10.195668223181556

 to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of <title> bingley s she could not make a very favourable answer 	11.077441994572705

 jane was by no means better 	31.518325860357844

 the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves 	10.932995975736416

 and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 	14.317751360839486

 their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency 	23.326947997386057

 his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others 	16.611461825615685

 she had very little notice from any but him 	19.664221484864647

 and as for <title> hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her 	10.041032509015652

 when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room 	16.664988040104642

 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence 	14.103580520277207

 she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty 	11.440543837328521

 she really looked almost wild 	27.945058744199898

 she did indeed louisa 	50.55802364288431

 i could hardly keep my countenance 	28.874574792673886

 very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold 	15.291267311786436

 her hair so untidy so blowsy yes and her petticoat 	12.424635030853258

 i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain 	11.380540290673531

 and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office 	14.64613033367227

 your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley 	17.237660764022916

 but this was all lost upon me 	31.246252321266173

 i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning 	15.033542637890074

 her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 	10.934724343853837

 you observed it <title> darcy i am sure said miss bingley 	17.113142973141724

 and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition 	20.639760768163956

 certainly not 	202.3300737942246

 to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it 	8.98821477951967

 it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley 	22.122198695229688

 not at all he replied 	28.7611264875062

 they were brightened by the exercise 	33.61404397024937

 a short pause followed this speech and <title> hurst began again 	14.885912237997719

 but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it 	16.841629724376784

 i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton 	17.475539101933705

 and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside 	15.443306425035212

 that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily 	16.65031868051938

 if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable 	12.670025407724435

 but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy 	13.54393396251179

 but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations 	9.854518751204429

 with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee 	11.368899204056133

 on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them 	13.151171110196628

 do you prefer reading to cards 	19.367826770484374

 said he 	78.4805001024808

 miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards 	21.76734365700938

 she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else 	17.5767899300202

 i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth 	9.801899919314533

 i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things 	22.87474690945934

 and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well 	16.887158493372986

 elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying 	18.066853688211175

 he immediately offered to fetch her others 	17.988483399427192

 all that his library afforded 	52.47103840909366

 and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit 	15.308982305392991

 but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into 	18.61048398929493

 elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 	16.750441081651953

 i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books 	15.248909356126624

 and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books 	23.239893472491087

 i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 	16.57438616617525

 i wish it may 	49.00657868546017

 but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model 	16.840009443226435

 there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire 	14.247629567075439

 with all my heart 	43.01042789619799

 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation 	15.138272751994204

 elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book 	26.004072207019934

 and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between <title> bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game 	9.76111745941868

 is miss darcy much grown since the spring 	20.027701972073768

 said miss bingley 	45.15263992181458

 will she be as tall as i am 	15.420853953569381

 i think she will 	45.8008021003065

 she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller 	15.962113821159791

 such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite 	13.557777145205714

 it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are 	17.546857154917127

 all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean 	15.867651497639212

 yes all of them i think 	44.753440690843014

 i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished 	15.636797932242814

 your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth 	18.936365417279987

 the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen 	8.929617566594793

 but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general 	16.383304938614486

 i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished 	14.557304237980508

 nor i i am sure said miss bingley 	19.618770896249128

 i do comprehend a great deal in it 	18.183547737325373

 oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with 	10.35286576947186

 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word 	11.913876990971534

 and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved 	14.431087854878946

 i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women 	12.914838528002493

 i rather wonder now at your knowing any  	16.36391321120317

 are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this 	17.414954010486355

 i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united 	10.814679890454975

 <title> hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when <title> hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward 	10.641166648908403

 as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 	12.91026563151476

 eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own 	12.843015561414528

 but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art 	21.58066119652935

 undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation 	9.575593060524831

 whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable 	11.388729186456777

 miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject 	19.038159582878105

 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her 	20.97391101086571

 bingley urged <title> jones s being sent for immediately 	17.06809619128327

 while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians 	15.433156027917954

 this she would not hear of 	40.089028431409325

 but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal 	19.904763167202447

 and it was settled that <title> jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better 	19.324310071901053

 bingley was quite uncomfortable 	68.17511327041201

 his sisters declared that they were miserable 	33.256646453904025

 they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister 	10.890634596348447

 chapter ix 	389.700158465448

 in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation 	14.51176098735452

 the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with 	10.322082784180894

 <title> bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast 	17.084906325245292

 had she found jane in any apparent danger <title> bennet would have been very miserable 	20.341910755674768

 but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield 	14.371900206544861

 she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home 	20.988593967592177

 neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable 	18.69318111596826

 after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 	11.660241911982457

 bingley met them with hopes that <title> bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected 	18.036610859967112

 indeed i have sir was her answer 	34.22262418110568

 she is a great deal too ill to be moved 	23.835348043871846

 <title> jones says we must not think of moving her 	20.592885055441204

 we must trespass a little longer on your kindness 	21.192701607679286

 removed cried bingley 	61.31002913361258

 it must not be thought of 	43.99331416442434

 my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal 	35.25562357796658

 you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us 	10.433120434601511

 <title> bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments 	24.91403018958562

 i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her  	17.144474375599792

 you have a sweet room here <title> bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 	13.219635130378991

 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield 	19.474503967104155

 you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease 	20.935110862036844

 whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he 	23.91660925555888

 and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes 	14.994486988165487

 at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here 	13.936815858320593

 that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth 	19.670462243763403

 you begin to comprehend me do you 	19.115477666730666

 cried he turning towards her 	23.50214969116919

 oh yes i understand you perfectly 	29.583930154507758

 i wish i might take this for a compliment 	26.673980538005523

 but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 	17.742420977674602

 that is as it happens 	46.14006633107446

 it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours 	10.95185426762523

 lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home 	17.685899179853475

 i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character 	13.090135434818462

 it must be an amusing study 	28.33199440467304

 but intricate characters are the most amusing 	32.99766897359887

 in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society 	13.044386603072784

 yes indeed cried <title> bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 	19.494753474397676

 i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town 	21.458170660624592

 every body was surprised 	37.87460726991305

 and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away 	18.168496774011714

 <title> bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph 	11.894004307305433

 the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it <title> bingley 	16.553930348619136

 when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it 	26.410289294205025

 and when i am in town it is pretty much the same 	24.864100051175303

 aye that is because you have the right disposition 	45.395112833929666

 but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all 	20.876552110446458

 indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother 	20.54680496753642

 you quite mistook <title> darcy 	22.750742784525205

 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true 	19.933179014907246

 certainly my dear nobody said there were 	23.20937179318229

 but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger 	15.612901902601097

 nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance 	18.799551656735392

 elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away 	14.432050085644997

 yes she called yesterday with her father 	25.81035488407532

 what an agreeable man sir william is <title> bingley is not he 	22.59230516970285

 so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body 	16.247703865442485

 that is my idea of good breeding 	30.20123500164755

 and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter 	7.943555786312548

 did charlotte dine with you 	24.34765245966221

 no she would go home 	47.8874140397978

 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies 	24.784037694152712

 for my part <title> bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work 	17.1590390395397

 my daughters are brought up differently 	28.715549677839434

 but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you 	16.799947170794812

 it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend 	14.867329020774402

 she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley 	21.518854034640064

 oh dear yes 	101.04427261278816

 but you must own she is very plain 	34.162363224532584

 lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty 	11.819926721387052

 i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking 	15.081358103219895

 it is what every body says 	28.322131886972908

 i do not trust my own partiality 	30.86158970333455

 when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away 	16.09926878550739

 but however he did not 	30.829034032353007

 perhaps he thought her too young 	42.93740857123991

 and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently 	26.07402001973185

 there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way 	23.096248020772773

 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy 	8.735227217569008

 of a fine stout healthy love it may 	13.853226303439467

 every thing nourishes what is strong already 	22.706462837123812

 but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away 	12.586063158822279

 darcy only smiled 	65.4187835592701

 and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 	10.845250701995532

 she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say 	19.457014636030348

 and after a short silence <title> bennet began repeating her thanks to <title> bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy 	12.482199906738577

 <title> bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required 	14.602258661744537

 she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but <title> bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 	11.416631095914815

 upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 	16.72778968236414

 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax <title> bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield 	14.848736018574176

 lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance 	12.823661235291599

 a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 	16.370617908965798

 she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance 	11.97898048437491

 she was very equal therefore to address <title> bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise 	16.343677219298705

 adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 	22.399239869699908

 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear 	17.123335528388015

 i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement 	17.49716990884601

 but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill 	32.41620597088207

 oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again 	15.696035055508174

 and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also 	16.669910135374735

 <title> bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and <title> darcy 	18.00033119968656

 the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes  	13.662300209521964

 chapter <initial> the day passed much as the day before had done 	27.117329922585515

 <title> hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend 	13.016761850687141

 <title> darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister 	10.560626475306492

 <title> hurst and <title> bingley were at piquet and <title> hurst was observing their game 	15.317119460838887

 elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion 	14.190904376782132

 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 	12.81804010871755

 how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer 	22.832634754221704

 you write uncommonly fast 	41.6457823985086

 you are mistaken 	53.038302756967

 i write rather slowly 	46.57267960605917

 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours 	12.531494208756778

 pray tell your sister that i long to see her 	28.04743469558296

 i am afraid you do not like your pen 	20.182008755611655

 let me mend it for you 	28.18451970778171

 thank you but i always mend my own 	29.762623787435547

 how can you contrive to write so even 	19.09518725896946

 he was silent 	86.40056860523137

 tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley <initial> will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again 	12.865170198529519

 oh it is of no consequence 	54.483854971735155

 i shall see her in january 	49.4466048085503

 but do you always write such charming long letters to her <title> darcy 	14.298305052497714

 they are generally long 	43.86344227761261

 but whether always charming it is not for me to determine 	23.373447038261336

 that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease 	17.920264967431937

 do not you darcy 	55.650978426534465

 my style of writing is very different from yours 	20.803579723033927

 he leaves out half his words and blots the rest 	10.664253184307842

 my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents 	11.806032707994813

 your humility <title> bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof 	21.819561203482962

 nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility 	20.468232921199863

 it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast 	11.140112457229272

 and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty 	19.377281997802186

 the indirect boast 	51.69422284164746

 for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting 	10.598983219611162

 the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance 	13.842054670154196

 when you told <title> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else 	12.471242067865948

 nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 	18.401430378287486

 and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment 	19.65181749898726

 at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies 	11.049919761662682

 i dare say you believed it 	20.31560617749989

 but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity 	23.59790396385113

 your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know 	15.94079251746347

 and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month 	12.7221002803922

 you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <title> bingley did not do justice to his own disposition 	20.938730482949527

 you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself 	17.66957872626227

 i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper 	13.317442782451534

 but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend 	14.33108842079045

 for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could 	13.473334592745404

 upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself 	13.98339707630846

 allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety 	12.665498546636384

 to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either 	14.483722978617504

 you appear to me <title> darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 	18.27163705109459

 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 	8.813012418016099

 i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about <title> bingley 	18.131334816491215

 we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon 	12.568582768488074

 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it 	12.502311411714349

 will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties 	9.660384930561056

 by all means cried bingley 	22.6504927354317

 let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size 	12.737168014601398

 for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of 	22.026019794964068

 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference 	14.115598830670299

 i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places 	12.410820872005244

 at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do 	20.200024874442125

 <title> darcy smiled 	87.53022961130517

 but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended 	30.270064550557

 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense 	12.588985816856324

 i see your design bingley said his friend 	20.57759299602552

 you dislike an argument and want to silence this 	15.068243458980652

 perhaps i do 	98.93270860613858

 arguments are too much like disputes 	37.55352628288896

 if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful 	20.84210593724588

 and then you may say whatever you like of me 	18.19839395648597

 and <title> darcy had much better finish his letter 	18.068181043821593

 <title> darcy took her advice and did finish his letter 	13.829843530394603

 when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 	21.67329302682056

 miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself 	10.722646978207157

 <title> hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently <title> darcy s eyes were fixed on her 	11.61421913098075

 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man 	16.8844968260992

 and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange 	20.597871951650944

 she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present 	12.750485389621854

 the supposition did not pain her 	32.05920431676843

 after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air 	10.394214470880222

 and soon afterwards <title> darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel 	15.970340715528087

 she smiled but made no answer 	20.04567205745523

 he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence 	24.081389920337937

 but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply 	21.508334688461197

 you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste 	21.361018455614204

 but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt 	11.072230642300891

 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare 	14.650583184659506

 indeed i do not dare 	61.72291132795608

 elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry 	16.916181081619197

 but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody 	16.043700708622005

 he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger 	26.10066749895488

 miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous 	23.40375395801803

 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance 	10.88569604325903

 i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue 	13.611217197967438

 and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers 	11.558129376814193

 and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses 	8.568744561765604

 have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity 	13.915666619970597

 do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley 	13.57265935227233

 put them next to your great uncle the judge 	16.99698031342729

 they are in the same profession you know 	26.73577122735909

 only in different lines 	32.62530343509904

 as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes 	13.839415769611648

 it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied 	10.482303998345255

 at that moment they were met from another walk by <title> hurst and elizabeth herself 	16.89787000269851

 i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard 	17.926457065880303

 then taking the disengaged arm of <title> darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself 	13.765913909324395

 the path just admitted three 	19.50488376450704

 <title> darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party 	12.856385059099784

 we had better go into the avenue 	33.73843661475773

 but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no 	17.329048864086193

 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth 	12.726667303958928

 she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 	15.009686217137743

 jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 	13.86037433144484

 chapter xi 	389.700158465448

 when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room 	10.68157058666861

 where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure 	17.672645518436337

 and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 	18.542367802996967

 their powers of conversation were considerable 	20.84118001802001

 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit 	8.74903538771928

 but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object 	24.218915010557037

 miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps 	18.936056192020835

 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation 	23.52624038779251

 <title> hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad 	21.827844990784413

 but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation 	17.276373331369903

 he was full of joy and attention 	22.43827051762278

 and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door 	19.075520924739823

 elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight 	19.63482173866275

 when tea was over <title> hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain 	16.843233025273026

 she had obtained private intelligence that <title> darcy did not wish for cards 	20.12506544686536

 and <title> hurst soon found even his open petition rejected 	12.330148791732402

 she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her 	20.92796959935214

 darcy took up a book 	27.330447518625522

 miss bingley did the same 	39.10702467147926

 and <title> hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet 	11.634189204944345

 miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching <title> darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own 	13.94307671452394

 she could not win him however to any conversation 	21.051308129125808

 he merely answered her question and read on 	18.7078872701635

 at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library 	13.937971928282206

 no one made any reply 	31.711060786587826

 she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement 	10.97180008990508

 when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield 	13.332607436340485

 i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party 	15.059179350003822

 if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing 	17.088284655036322

 and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards 	9.907867227582864

 i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner 	15.062556737634297

 but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 	17.947342801393834

 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day 	12.857295435179148

 much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball 	16.946465826292744

 miss bingley made no answer 	27.61961829633721

 and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 	16.315678196734325

 her figure was elegant and she walked well 	22.31111343930668

 but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious 	15.238879803614909

 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more 	21.342024174882706

 i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude 	15.714223918873778

 elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately 	23.07597741311028

 <title> darcy looked up 	42.21053237380423

 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book 	13.812639600378084

 he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere 	9.982566864908629

 what could he mean 	63.38561518437781

 not at all was her answer 	28.280963766728114

 but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it 	11.875521415995543

 miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <title> darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives 	13.377486871010241

 i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak 	13.038861884582987

 you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking 	10.077430542953618

 if the first i should be completely in your way 	28.576863352905626

 and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire 	20.721721025388543

 oh shocking cried miss bingley 	27.05510424255402

 i never heard any thing so abominable 	26.31122760083171

 how shall we punish him for such a speech 	26.79862258594484

 nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth 	23.469114589846793

 we can all plague and punish one another 	13.10664453742382

 teaze him laugh at him 	40.938609644545615

 but upon my honour i do not  	21.045808242684153

 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that  	17.23785328918936

 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there 	13.765553181186096

 and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject 	12.790839107913524

 <title> darcy may hug himself 	22.825051114782028

 <title> darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth 	19.882426048301394

 i dearly love a laugh 	28.14274056566872

 miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be 	20.888291399473434

 certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them  	19.676693864318157

 i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good 	19.742846757198674

 follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can 	10.938200160641582

 but these i suppose are precisely what you are without 	21.35165752403986

 perhaps that is not possible for any one 	30.586920244434783

 but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule 	11.43688230979015

 such as vanity and pride 	28.974360639860997

 yes vanity is a weakness indeed 	42.86706370869103

 but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation 	15.473710712806012

 elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 	23.544925674591877

 your examination of <title> darcy is over i presume said miss bingley 	13.501496502775211

 i am perfectly convinced by it that <title> darcy has no defect 	20.53265130982709

 he owns it himself without disguise 	20.111367311594904

 no said darcy i have made no such pretension 	36.878391120767866

 i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding 	19.012160265753206

 my temper i dare not vouch for 	19.46264795922271

 it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world 	13.852474847004165

 i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself 	10.342403988506689

 my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them 	13.947088904277253

 my temper would perhaps be called resentful 	20.613609434427932

 my good opinion once lost is lost for ever 	13.942949062994789

 that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth 	17.569038455096706

 implacable resentment is a shade in a character 	38.47560273424959

 but you have chosen your fault well 	25.74876893488555

 i really cannot laugh at it 	26.54033313615032

 you are safe from me 	29.144673107116308

 there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome 	9.43876906129663

 and your defect is a propensity to hate every body 	14.58760616957619

 and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them 	15.2091088496225

 do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share 	19.333099297861693

 her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it 	12.415661238143624

 he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 	18.17863797471847

 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day 	16.530379992059387

 her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home 	22.909379810171703

 <title> bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday 	17.584867996787615

 against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked 	12.430942311176189

 and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow <title> bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made 	11.45450161739482

 the communication excited many professions of concern 	14.106142670034512

 and till the morrow their going was deferred 	17.45891221748691

 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 	12.906936554767874

 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered 	15.976848798669979

 but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right 	29.708537769636994

 to <title> darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough 	20.34963584933447

 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity 	10.353723873792479

 sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it 	13.217550706358457

 steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her 	12.40579370119394

 on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place 	10.124765869844772

 miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane 	16.388210138200137

 and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former 	12.65086636225747

 elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits 	28.68725613094141

 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother 	12.19155721816041

 <title> bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again 	14.46603657585314

 but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them 	16.10292558451272

 he had felt their importance in the family circle 	27.38907678860283

 the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth 	12.391700763722573

 they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature 	10.998034162653779

 and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to 	7.68169810570846

 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort 	24.613460392173003

 much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday 	22.128958174980138

 several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married 	12.756088714673803

 i hope my dear said <title> bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party 	15.570552411531386

 who do you mean my dear 	30.483089602419245

 i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her 	12.05996862939528

 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger 	23.11078396202886

 <title> bennet s eyes sparkled 	26.3930321410701

 a gentleman and a stranger it is <title> bingley i am sure 	21.672970653332698

 why jane you never dropt a word of this 	19.840322466175078

 you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see <title> bingley 	13.507266139723217

 but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day 	16.05119764907891

 lydia my love ring the bell 	20.667802664018676

 i must speak to hill this moment 	21.969858083742228

 it is not <title> bingley said her husband 	30.3096903329338

 it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life 	23.71653885719528

 this roused a general astonishment 	26.42140481245383

 and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once 	14.302948879236341

 about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention 	11.98845849836944

 it is from my cousin <title> collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases 	18.14853612933466

 oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned 	18.93256881947811

 pray do not talk of that odious man 	41.42102587057477

 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children 	16.03183848925552

 and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it 	15.945599243889857

 jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail 	19.315094414234135

 and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 	10.226533574657688

 it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said <title> bennet and nothing can clear <title> collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn 	14.556726019727934

 but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself 	21.783153716274356

 no that i am sure i shall not 	19.95385600896186

 and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical 	26.407981606548738

 i hate such false friends 	27.425186549681722

 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him 	19.022730139330836

 why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear 	17.275716854931144

 hunsford near westerham kent 15th october 	11.267505439540923

 dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach 	9.610927216323716

 but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance 	13.730745005122111

 there <title> bennet 	69.49411152072497

 my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england 	8.960381931659272

 as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence 	10.10773041431936

 and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch 	10.12250990523892

 i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter 	12.229844408954348

 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 	9.0637404803311

 i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins 	9.583285859037497

 at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said <title> bennet as he folded up the letter 	10.216711354666725

 he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word 	16.44628936623577

 and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again 	13.183708767027968

 there is some sense in what he says about the girls however 	20.61831241626253

 and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him 	17.23359169647746

 though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit 	12.589605619333973

 elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required 	10.103725792084466

 he must be an oddity i think said she 	20.564882277658683

 i cannot make him out 	47.33230349061361

 there is something very pompous in his style 	25.814742408408776

 and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail 	14.905443691956375

 we cannot suppose he would help it if he could 	22.219480277280304

 can he be a sensible man sir 	29.303030862195804

 no my dear 	52.84072692346476

 i think not 	99.3112164742621

 i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse 	16.65330311136102

 there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well 	13.31332016423994

 i am impatient to see him 	24.08285998098717

 in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective 	14.132645330263397

 the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed 	17.49001467654397

 to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 	14.857658678712284

 it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 	16.433605357997525

 as for their mother <title> collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters 	16.60700105592668

 <title> collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family 	20.540666001088507

 <title> bennet indeed said little 	33.72038956188475

 but the ladies were ready enough to talk and <title> collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself 	14.266507373750803

 he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty 	13.759643307760825

 his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal 	17.236357470835

 he had not been long seated before he complimented <title> bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth 	13.34171584619851

 and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 	13.925056922265943

 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but <title> bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure 	14.60102373355638

 and i wish with all my heart it may prove so 	20.38347128849036

 for else they will be destitute enough 	25.079779388307315

 things are settled so oddly 	22.05048663305511

 you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate 	30.50134285698082

 ah sir i do indeed 	78.67374825576992

 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess 	16.579659956839986

 not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world 	19.021340808148143

 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed 	13.705578833653867

 but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 	19.53434703236596

 at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner 	15.581145746727096

 and the girls smiled on each other 	19.845480117185787

 and his commendation of every thing would have touched <title> bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property 	17.37630743639331

 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired 	16.731186225305304

 and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing 	14.935950059628482

 but here he was set right by <title> bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 	19.00977509079615

 he begged pardon for having displeased her 	21.13379383818883

 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended 	15.052379593476012

 chapter xiv 	389.700158465448

 during dinner <title> bennet scarcely spoke at all 	23.097827149433805

 but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness 	14.558200127051556

 lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable 	13.6373069801151

 <title> bennet could not have chosen better 	27.331070230422227

 <title> collins was eloquent in her praise 	23.268870645994458

 she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 	12.384739487713313

 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 	12.725484924980023

 she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations 	16.102101620693706

 she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion 	14.077791978748733

 and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage 	24.146899486876595

 where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs 	11.08370047594104

 that is all very proper and civil i am sure said <title> bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 	14.187044646597446

 it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 	14.753823328631945

 does she live near you sir 	16.687818229275702

 the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence 	10.108641821671851

 i think you said she was a widow sir 	31.310089923198117

 she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property 	11.922851525250907

 ah cried <title> bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls 	16.750290842053367

 and what sort of young lady is she 	24.313060235445835

 is she handsome 	62.21300484001981

 she is a most charming young lady indeed 	26.269191287213182

 lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex 	14.78445210221701

 because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth 	19.164989974913333

 she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of 	9.674826945045112

 but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies 	11.169463578381148

 has she been presented 	46.62103506489936

 i do not remember her name among the ladies at court 	15.914196962151467

 her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town 	11.161422633002056

 and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament 	11.852123248595806

 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies 	12.275165285356334

 i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her 	12.34553436129955

 these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 	12.485845147561214

 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study 	11.243711822354049

 they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 	9.716771900990546

 <title> bennet s expectations were fully answered 	14.576871920095588

 his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure 	12.723467533921724

 by tea time however the dose had been enough and <title> bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 	14.070012795428141

 <title> collins readily assented and a book was produced 	17.434244011504735

 but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels 	12.297871275807987

 kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed 	44.41516223926082

 other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons 	8.867725626389703

 lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him 	8.737190575153607

 my aunt told me so herself on saturday 	23.910498005667417

 lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue 	12.330321360392157

 but <title> collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit 	10.694125660258896

 it amazes me i confess 	34.13624996102995

 but i will no longer importune my young cousin 	16.984789366703552

 <title> bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements 	11.228064453372658

 <title> bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book 	12.56901048089763

 but <title> collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with <title> bennet and prepared for backgammon 	10.457139883763258

 chapter xv 	389.700158465448

 and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance 	11.001692284536121

 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant 	12.099526415117484

 and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility 	13.378956395664005

 and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 	14.612506346573898

 this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate 	10.88503871198916

 his plan did not vary on seeing them 	21.088369024146104

 miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority 	10.158384469940763

 and for the first evening she was his settled choice 	27.340047378631233

 the next morning however made an alteration 	17.372483540315468

 for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with <title> bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 	11.810583786405354

 as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession 	20.983510586434953

 her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged 	14.457781853884253

 <title> collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while <title> bennet was stirring the fire 	15.64198928022234

 elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course 	16.34118935004854

 <title> bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married 	15.036033338552045

 every sister except mary agreed to go with her 	15.120130195504942

 and <title> collins was to attend them at the request of <title> bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself 	17.27113230854722

 for thither <title> collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to <title> bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford 	12.493474739991795

 such doings discomposed <title> bennet exceedingly 	26.429856369662215

 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity 	21.032974111019474

 and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there 	18.406694157545214

 his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting <title> collins to join his daughters in their walk 	13.058871457156474

 and <title> collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go 	11.213150179561795

 in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton 	12.082933456244648

 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him  	20.089237251365024

 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them 	10.392535814088912

 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way 	15.216470988253647

 the officer was the very <title> denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed 	12.928870702488249

 all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 	8.907474182174896

 <title> denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend <title> wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps 	13.568619050133721

 this was exactly as it should be 	31.253115748614334

 for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming 	16.241792974327815

 his appearance was greatly in his favour 	24.119949878061025

 he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address 	17.562424414213794

 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming 	9.607113677223577

 on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities 	15.115610833726434

 bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object 	21.001423143234422

 he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her 	19.25478483790614

 <title> darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 	15.922098737127566

 both changed colour one looked white the other red 	14.362773454393496

 <title> wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which <title> darcy just deigned to return 	10.228878906781667

 what could be the meaning of it 	25.201717341140355

 it was impossible to imagine 	28.623849664488453

 it was impossible not to long to know 	20.710506014496353

 in another minute <title> bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend 	11.13553890174904

 <title> denny and <title> wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of <title> philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of <title> philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation 	13.478438751131637

 <title> philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see <title> jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards <title> collins by jane s introduction of him 	11.5149896634004

 she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 	15.35795162222794

 <title> philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding 	16.022204894881373

 but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that <title> denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire 	12.894245197627045

 some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on <title> wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening 	16.4543845993271

 this was agreed to and <title> philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 	11.342787945808817

 the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits 	13.812450326417407

 <title> collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless 	11.511723856179698

 as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen 	14.570711703811519

 but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister 	14.076729232858579

 <title> collins on his return highly gratified <title> bennet by admiring <title> philips s manners and politeness 	14.397538934690356

 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman 	17.256160627588734

 for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before 	13.916413081838414

 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 	19.02325986580932

 chapter xvi 	389.700158465448

 as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all <title> collins s scruples of leaving <title> and <title> bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton 	10.641897786090025

 and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that <title> wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house 	16.368780494310773

 when this information was given and they had all taken their seats <title> collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings 	14.03430308931322

 a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification 	17.460752498666146

 in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them 	12.051625025141776

 and he found in <title> philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could 	12.734691721850636

 to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long 	11.817227736558829

 it was over at last however 	39.21930249592111

 the gentlemen did approach 	37.0283901970521

 and when <title> wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 	16.161776995471552

 the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party 	22.083872757550214

 but <title> wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room 	10.404486024187072

 and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 	11.433465701363637

 with such rivals for the notice of the fair as <title> wickham and the officers <title> collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance 	19.80792351637837

 to the young ladies he certainly was nothing 	21.134098043949074

 when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist 	13.769327170385344

 i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life <title> philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason 	17.504197694178618

 at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker 	16.95193393614822

 but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular 	9.967391428652551

 allowing for the common demands of the game <title> wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with <title> darcy 	17.27375635020285

 she dared not even mention that gentleman 	19.188065529872034

 her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved 	22.805086616047443

 <title> wickham began the subject himself 	43.11534888075941

 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton 	15.94130004483006

 about a month said elizabeth 	24.434459811185402

 yes replied wickham 	108.41062449503771

 his estate there is a noble one 	27.101036619444

 a clear ten thousand per annum 	16.499768771516386

 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy 	15.718767181326932

 you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 	13.431300702797142

 are you much acquainted with <title> darcy 	18.2322753388394

 as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable 	21.412178580978207

 i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise 	18.921242758429017

 i am not qualified to form one 	17.924510451498197

 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge 	18.729431591402772

 it is impossible for me to be impartial 	34.26743089410971

 here you are in your own family 	45.45957891810854

 upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield 	17.765750079220826

 he is not at all liked in hertfordshire 	25.03869421136425

 every body is disgusted with his pride 	22.37409707587244

 you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one 	14.256098464025609

 i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts 	15.5890665654796

 but with him i believe it does not often happen 	31.839267185685024

 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen 	11.545464778533674

 i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man 	15.302106891421385

 wickham only shook his head 	19.879487075310557

 i do not at all know 	30.055315143086663

 i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 	20.216951710664333

 oh no it is not for me to be driven away by <title> darcy 	21.584236728823146

 if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go 	20.052088750946766

 we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world 	13.965384525604057

 a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is 	12.78789361623152

 his father miss bennet the late <title> darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had 	14.745709987556022

 and i can never be in company with this <title> darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections 	19.380730377399857

 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous 	33.642508096704304

 but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father 	11.926802592991185

 elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart 	20.967760056231164

 but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry 	25.85431029002924

 <title> wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry 	10.466463179277467

 it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire 	11.552435062356352

 i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them 	11.870294705898027

 i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude 	19.064981233181186

 i must have employment and society 	24.84115863891151

 a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible 	15.270807830327906

 the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now 	15.183131517568935

 indeed yes the late <title> darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 	20.745942499873443

 he was my godfather and excessively attached to me 	11.510880555138794

 i cannot do justice to his kindness 	26.891092360629038

 he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it 	18.497266601513388

 but when the living fell it was given elsewhere 	28.13218358173009

 good heavens cried elizabeth 	23.515501493712847

 but how could that be 	47.288879430889594

 how could his will be disregarded 	41.80271342982058

 why did not you seek legal redress 	25.490547242511614

 there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law 	19.15399646596419

 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but <title> darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing 	11.832171656236001

 certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man 	17.619454265297833

 and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it 	15.717557846872568

 but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me 	21.32635647288711

 this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced 	20.64271969628115

 some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me  	24.42588373401925

 till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him  	17.851571995523273

 elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 	18.097157628630423

 what can have induced him to behave so cruelly 	20.97940924702095

 a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy 	13.78926537365918

 had the late <title> darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better 	16.165252454822056

 but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life 	16.48888931557371

 i had not thought <title> darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper 	12.083488018537917

 his disposition must be dreadful 	52.58190586135139

 i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him 	15.929643181921843

 elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together 	11.02165169688009

 inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care 	21.034444818592284

 my father began life in the profession which your uncle <title> philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late <title> darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property 	17.107556777245545

 he was most highly esteemed by <title> darcy a most intimate confidential friend 	16.668752251513347

 <title> darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death <title> darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself 	13.525995097305747

 how strange cried elizabeth 	41.01743619549922

 how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this <title> darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it 	15.064938399775

 it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride 	14.251725841451847

 and pride has often been his best friend 	20.142852778884166

 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling 	13.10296578243492

 and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride 	17.98041667693821

 can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good 	13.470259951956905

 family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this 	15.896795606539085

 not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive 	12.069107406808214

 he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister 	10.022929799871934

 and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers 	14.87708590802146

 what sort of a girl is miss darcy 	28.055009042927292

 he shook his head 	30.955070062224312

 i wish i could call her amiable 	22.247636537003295

 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy 	23.18063348471785

 but she is too much like her brother very very proud 	26.55257118896501

 as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me 	14.74641575835137

 and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement 	20.802408158297638

 but she is nothing to me now 	50.1899514950486

 she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished 	12.67663689507027

 since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education 	14.158704973246735

 how can they suit each other 	17.775534064034485

 do you know <title> bingley 	40.159637593814054

 not at all 	28.286963212024187

 he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man 	16.513500568225336

 he cannot know what <title> darcy is 	27.827504140264516

 probably not 	215.48691772451787

 he does not want abilities 	42.37043588309487

 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while 	15.092167091515766

 among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous 	19.042113954474203

 his pride never deserts him 	23.058223705617504

 the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and <title> collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and <title> philips 	11.236846691829458

 it had not been very great 	40.510573704681114

 he had lost every point 	36.30951234439623

 but when <title> philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy 	13.912816422805943

 i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object 	12.148922872462382

 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 	11.491511610205272

 <title> wickham s attention was caught 	31.76281650015633

 and after observing <title> collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh 	12.041091936514185

 lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living 	12.614117769115818

 i hardly know how <title> collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long 	18.598659141457603

 you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters 	12.828357135068062

 consequently that she is aunt to the present <title> darcy 	35.13820617051031

 no indeed i did not 	29.1657324402586

 i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections 	23.049316272299617

 i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 	24.005170274465904

 her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 	18.50750703430082

 this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley 	14.987529980371496

 vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another 	14.4667418259935

 <title> collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter 	15.516517359183823

 but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman 	13.690097813097767

 i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham 	25.155816808522708

 i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent 	18.50301035753505

 but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class 	15.477679362277597

 elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards 	13.873013502245964

 and gave the rest of the ladies their share of <title> wickham s attentions 	22.080578970731175

 whatever he said was said well 	39.21972459593453

 and whatever he did done gracefully 	34.74300950668091

 elizabeth went away with her head full of him 	34.99094966716242

 she could think of nothing but of <title> wickham and of what he had told her all the way home 	25.003180707849218

 but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor <title> collins were once silent 	15.747249957771604

 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and <title> collins in describing the civility of <title> and <title> philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house 	11.150623480502208

 jane listened with astonishment and concern 	26.42114553113638

 she knew not how to believe that <title> darcy could be so unworthy of <title> bingley s regard 	19.9337039906667

 and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham 	14.971508504957429

 the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings 	12.518544914952027

 and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained 	12.37722276069118

 they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea 	15.590600760887979

 interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other 	15.809141568924698

 it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side 	8.676746112338042

 very true indeed 	53.36178895123124

 do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody 	15.065232820833767

 laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion 	20.259922183215863

 my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places <title> darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for 	12.783037072498361

 no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it 	18.153633242746576

 can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him 	14.661231766158961

 oh no 	276.47575873194734

 i can much more easily believe <title> bingley s being imposed on than that <title> wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night 	14.702196600724962

 names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony 	21.320293616036075

 besides there was truth in his looks 	53.55622821513343

 it is difficult indeed it is distressing 	32.275216137033965

 one does not know what to think 	24.053130795863996

 i beg your pardon 	28.313668019764414

 one knows exactly what to think 	22.496104260152915

 but jane could think with certainty on only one point that <title> bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public 	16.452708584389416

 the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking 	16.43373791604441

 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation 	10.66517672495715

 to the rest of the family they paid little attention 	15.571092172618933

 avoiding <title> bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others 	25.530125380497037

 they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from <title> bennet s civilities 	10.779770949215074

 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 	19.21237142419439

 <title> bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from <title> bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card 	15.337029517772942

 and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with <title> wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in <title> darcy s looks and behaviour 	15.93083500447582

 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with <title> wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball 	11.68978556764736

 and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it 	16.78057942663301

 while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough 	22.098733470836606

 society has claims on us all 	18.27014757251513

 and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body 	8.970537912014956

 and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance 	10.087721789202218

 i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency 	12.59269402002753

 and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her 	13.296296434811305

 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have <title> collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed 	12.53599678515361

 there was no help for it however 	28.795719464279674

 <title> wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and <title> collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could 	12.35482159652271

 she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more 	18.49414279212611

 it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors 	10.709279472553296

 the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity 	10.53881414992381

 and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her  	17.277460159002857

 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply 	17.294173708004827

 <title> collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him 	14.840266674321121

 if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once 	16.56146479053289

 no aunt no officers no news could be sought after 	13.53232641619302

 the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy 	9.466007791639424

 and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia 	10.844840483353847

 till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for <title> wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her 	10.802050722338063

 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her 	12.536061499465672

 she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 	15.214499362183872

 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for <title> darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers 	15.897463410192458

 and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend <title> denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned 	13.990323986241092

 adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here 	15.241448282108141

 this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make 	11.69600244790112

 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to <title> bingley whose blind partiality provoked her 	13.876191010083632

 but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour 	28.701480677133514

 and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits 	17.071808713098264

 and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice 	16.993532977069073

 the two first dances however brought a return of distress 	11.278266307299004

 they were dances of mortification 	28.60130261271651

 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy 	29.52595754264518

 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by <title> darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him 	15.712138742253545

 he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind 	16.506859843027737

 charlotte tried to console her 	35.24777613388573

 i dare say you will find him very agreeable 	22.08808016151658

 heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil 	15.871466989565246

 when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 	11.29955754137586

 elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to <title> darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it 	11.971277801874374

 and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it 	17.854366160043107

 till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance 	14.583759177854427

 he replied and was again silent 	46.96221410108905

 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now <title> darcy 	14.653977978831785

 i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples 	19.16828374635725

 he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 	23.312334214053536

 very well 	111.0400571099049

 that reply will do for the present 	26.1939110540024

 perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 	8.83293372501379

 but now we may be silent 	42.99819808760695

 one must speak a little you know 	28.261818411416165

 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 	15.053895212538238

 are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine 	18.661806444470066

 both replied elizabeth archly 	63.326801552719004

 for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 	23.40617889398433

 we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb 	12.548771975023639

 this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he 	16.37009725177481

 how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say 	18.297705035907068

 you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 	20.977901106911265

 i must not decide on my own performance 	30.366947400473357

 he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton 	18.187844206501254

 she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance 	10.778364575075122

 the effect was immediate 	44.43683386853739

 a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on 	12.699673231756343

 at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said <title> wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain 	10.885962298766447

 he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life 	17.145974921093575

 darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject 	11.116964866844532

 at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room 	12.764775859387834

 but on perceiving <title> darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 	13.112664546784533

 i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir 	16.79406181348136

 such very superior dancing is not often seen 	24.292806650400866

 it is evident that you belong to the first circles 	32.9381135613678

 allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place 	13.811504761342844

 what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to <title> darcy but let me not interrupt you sir 	9.916443701951163

 you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me 	10.115721334643707

 the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy 	18.509133783812636

 but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together 	14.180288680581855

 recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of 	13.037178199834287

 i do not think we were speaking at all 	18.203073385655074

 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 	17.649489132174235

 we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine 	13.641636020120375

 what think you of books 	38.66040310779593

 said he smiling 	94.97453114178839

 books oh no 	68.69764069604727

 i am sorry you think so 	25.479051646434243

 we may compare our different opinions 	18.74391786671195

 my head is always full of something else 	23.578571380830567

 the present always occupies you in such scenes does it 	15.877799155914026

 said he with a look of doubt 	30.696338893470767

 i hope not 	75.59645067583315

 it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first 	12.187098353686453

 may i ask to what these questions tend 	15.858781185313285

 merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity 	18.545106322817023

 i am trying to make it out 	26.51097934956392

 and what is your success 	50.337341370292954

 she shook her head 	37.810932746386314

 i do not get on at all 	19.866378996346853

 i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me 	7.594871514563536

 and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either 	13.83873848925712

 i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied 	12.899087011730202

 she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence 	20.58988907738867

 on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another 	10.213937760996698

 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions 	13.163898542534682

 and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late <title> darcy s steward 	13.422364996758088

 for as to <title> darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false 	21.689912480523763

 for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated <title> darcy in a most infamous manner 	16.413277388702134

 his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it 	18.822964751242875

 i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt 	15.587082480171379

 but really considering his descent one could not expect much better 	17.513119191984956

 his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily 	19.916100621892678

 for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of <title> darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself 	14.497959684121607

 i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer 	18.284126252098407

 it was kindly meant 	42.49554556297356

 insolent girl said elizabeth to herself 	38.987554676076314

 you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this 	14.901300547469113

 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of <title> darcy 	17.110067694296013

 she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley 	17.393375666309602

 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening 	12.445270492620992

 elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness 	13.360313281726889

 i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about <title> wickham 	16.818605397492526

 but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person 	20.228667407208352

 in which case you may be sure of my pardon 	35.18651511648866

 no replied jane i have not forgotten him 	30.52416073553085

 <title> bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended <title> darcy 	14.501049668838512

 but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that <title> wickham has deserved much less attention from <title> darcy than he has received 	16.3093037463089

 and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s <title> wickham is by no means a respectable young man 	15.454243071794037

 i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose <title> darcy s regard 	14.083272766543747

 <title> bingley does not know <title> wickham himself 	32.822930968600446

 he never saw him till the other morning at meryton 	31.317685531054863

 i am perfectly satisfied 	32.499024827228915

 but what does he say of the living 	34.44665665843093

 he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from <title> darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only 	16.679624811347473

 i have not a doubt of <title> bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly 	21.47978370883385

 but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 	15.30261438273408

 <title> bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 	13.506231565483157

 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it 	11.558860843896321

 on their being joined by <title> bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas 	16.892429896497404

 to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before <title> collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 	15.711435978123463

 i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness 	16.696621000775135

 i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine 	12.901914852317391

 you are not going to introduce yourself to <title> darcy 	17.849361552325437

 indeed i am 	59.86335517299251

 i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 	13.988902436406843

 i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew  	31.83133757171209

 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night 	17.048001698155367

 elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme 	20.743151289634614

 assuring him that <title> darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt 	13.358964038448047

 <title> collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy 	10.730100392853592

 for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained 	11.991208870350404

 you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 	13.779772925315738

 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself 	9.242752258423648

 and with a low bow he left her to attack <title> darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident 	12.928398465965708

 her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh 	14.044824301630534

 it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man 	21.518228269867958

 <title> darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last <title> collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility 	13.90188904980027

 <title> collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and <title> darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way 	13.633614962042815

 <title> collins then returned to elizabeth 	27.515120605485578

 i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception 	17.79599158981214

 <title> darcy seemed much pleased with the attention 	24.80153422592791

 he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily 	14.898640802417106

 it was really a very handsome thought 	31.96677554359706

 upon the whole i am much pleased with him 	26.55941901627019

 as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and <title> bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 	12.073386070620577

 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow 	16.95640890203378

 when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other 	11.735255961178929

 and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to <title> bingley 	14.787869427622347

 it was an animating subject and <title> bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match 	12.359331340390234

 his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation 	16.073733058322347

 and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do 	18.411997493463236

 it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men 	15.002020514312667

 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette 	14.024750505449608

 but no one was less likely than <title> bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 	15.190922606547561

 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 	11.025952322846228

 for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by <title> darcy who sat opposite to them 	17.03477860121703

 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 	20.724092404218403

 what is <title> darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him 	24.618325810360965

 for heaven s sake madam speak lower 	16.197061505386696

 what advantage can it be to you to offend <title> darcy 	19.817885627786097

 you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 	19.47437969819314

 nothing that she could say however had any influence 	34.39382568094607

 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone 	24.79006104952617

 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation 	13.134177624445025

 she could not help frequently glancing her eye at <title> darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded 	13.512957038048947

 for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her 	19.271690516531336

 the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity 	11.81787471712484

 at length however <title> bennet had no more to say 	19.8017341397154

 and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 	10.948688968322836

 elizabeth now began to revive 	51.16126430779815

 but not long was the interval of tranquillity 	30.70362507049003

 for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company 	10.972971407745804

 by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain 	10.73377658945096

 mary would not understand them 	66.74068149465002

 such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song 	17.11567607648652

 elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations 	22.73053032718013

 mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display 	17.343033708686253

 her voice was weak and her manner affected 	26.083972484485237

 she looked at jane to see how she bore it 	23.647295754713156

 but jane was very composedly talking to bingley 	27.681628518992568

 she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave 	11.582903600069075

 she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night 	12.235281471355137

 he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child 	11.419253653346495

 you have delighted us long enough 	22.029641109032582

 let the other young ladies have time to exhibit 	34.07522539525126

 mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted 	19.959996944383484

 others of the party were now applied to 	26.294978905346458

 if i said <title> collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air 	14.267676282618496

 for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman 	15.233140036290786

 i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to 	13.276416211819154

 the rector of a parish has much to do 	20.411696013418172

 in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 	14.719380163074954

 and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible 	13.606282623251868

 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment 	10.222790661529178

 i cannot acquit him of that duty 	30.49690798472827

 nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family 	13.022126001793833

 and with a bow to <title> darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room 	14.077004781953713

 many stared 	227.23558575544504

 many smiled 	227.13411775734485

 to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success 	12.89528536848757

 that his two sisters and <title> darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable 	14.211023171161843

 the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 	20.541852239209636

 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room 	15.388581674039447

 he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it 	24.847214273128056

 there was no arguing upon such a project 	23.343049557647944

 she was at least free from the offence of <title> darcy s farther notice 	19.11894681524172

 though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak 	15.948408688489076

 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to <title> wickham and rejoiced in it 	17.43029969103885

 and by a manoeuvre of <title> bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family 	12.655776256748775

 <title> hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves 	11.171461043730645

 they repulsed every attempt of <title> bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of <title> collins who was complimenting <title> bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests 	13.552764330832973

 <title> bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene 	12.180151654719726

 <title> bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other 	14.606039822467322

 and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn 	12.431090036920413

 when at length they arose to take leave <title> bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn 	14.21310109395847

 and addressed herself particularly to <title> bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation 	14.435386829576494

 bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time 	13.453675364359801

 <title> bennet was perfectly satisfied 	33.53000958656608

 and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months 	10.784937618687422

 of having another daughter married to <title> collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure 	13.505950633720412

 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children 	37.69491338665674

 and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by <title> bingley and netherfield 	15.17912710714055

 chapter xix 	389.700158465448

 the next day opened a new scene at longbourn 	13.834675665761248

 having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business 	12.604990236063836

 on finding <title> bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning 	14.462920396296974

 before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise <title> bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly 	14.645648579597504

 i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection 	15.188703752044649

 come kitty i want you up stairs 	19.252529193075684

 and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma am do not go 	12.619397919662672

 <title> collins must excuse me 	25.17569676244748

 he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear 	26.00988021881376

 i am going away myself 	29.980850727758458

 no no nonsense lizzy 	42.00404329845342

 and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing <title> collins 	8.994701003232933

 elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 	10.904426983101336

 <title> bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone <title> collins began 	17.788508319652244

 believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections 	11.606369457791462

 you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness 	15.779635440163265

 but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address 	19.26804555826532

 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble 	11.374806807688609

 my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 	32.78088613566345

 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life 	16.243574949148922

 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did 	12.773813652333985

 the idea of <title> collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish 	10.344165379660032

 secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness 	21.436121431350063

 and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness 	13.457191782097196

 twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject 	13.431093583252261

 and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while <title> jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said <title> collins you must marry 	9.93909819556314

 a clergyman like you must marry 	30.336846371526022

 chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake 	13.994479551891935

 and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way 	12.406926817478002

 this is my advice 	63.36320077783733

 find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her 	22.117446213493267

 and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 	13.08263006216933

 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony 	18.41260579541787

 it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women 	12.554413537005475

 this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem 	17.283110866769036

 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 	19.879928124458733

 and that one thousand pounds in the <number> per cents 	23.281273077215385

 which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to 	17.328531250745563

 on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent 	18.994515757270694

 and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married 	10.349775452698662

 you are too hasty sir she cried 	15.549424127340176

 you forget that i have made no answer 	27.814726423129777

 let me do it without farther loss of time 	21.054721428168595

 accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 	26.645317298674296

 i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them 	18.811298149028335

 and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time 	10.023327277559535

 i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 	12.665311236732107

 upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 	9.268042131248409

 i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time 	13.461047131779203

 i am perfectly serious in my refusal 	28.494082437724032

 you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so 	18.755844098662763

 nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation 	18.08743688174983

 were it certain that lady catherine would think so said <title> collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 	15.278484410371732

 indeed <title> collins all praise of me will be unnecessary 	32.81528969704778

 i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 	13.510319755913343

 in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach 	12.176365684530117

 this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled 	15.884656936993874

 and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not <title> collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me 	15.99063382185804

 though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character 	13.912154146006381

 really <title> collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly 	15.077554064053897

 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one 	14.383504454292519

 you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course 	12.821231482216648

 my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable 	12.03124215845533

 your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications 	11.51115151004328

 as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females 	14.751878610037528

 i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere 	21.213643850658066

 i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible 	17.870754807366463

 my feelings in every respect forbid it 	23.587425979202916

 can i speak plainer 	51.96452102599884

 do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart 	13.24927602072395

 you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry 	13.311947884806873

 and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable 	13.3195200547216

 to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew 	12.33181266272906

 determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female 	10.572607067691012

 chapter xx 	674.9804741797982

 <title> collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love 	22.862748057734322

 for <title> bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 	11.372473957032947

 <title> collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 	11.761059968237987

 this information however startled <title> bennet 	16.625861971949615

 she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so 	15.471849937814447

 she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest 	17.116532274992093

 but i will make her know it 	36.90958993168314

 pardon me for interrupting you madam cried <title> collins 	15.430361862309645

 but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state 	15.506894890976193

 if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity 	11.166833463937314

 sir you quite misunderstand me said <title> bennet alarmed 	22.277079635019458

 lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these 	17.124933460837276

 she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh <title> bennet you are wanted immediately 	16.106957707467874

 we are all in an uproar 	57.24598774699551

 you must come and make lizzy marry <title> collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her  	16.30964863770936

 <title> bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 	15.894114201540317

 i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech 	17.221564165557904

 of what are you talking 	35.52941134119224

 of <title> collins and lizzy 	29.216176078882228

 and what am i to do on the occasion 	26.444716646433957

 it seems an hopeless business 	25.285387093635926

 speak to lizzy about it yourself 	33.102017589427334

 tell her that you insist upon her marrying him 	26.70705126036776

 let her be called down 	37.85184766102087

 she shall hear my opinion 	32.96916833937464

 come here child cried her father as she appeared 	29.891663396953973

 i have sent for you on an affair of importance 	19.946403364946054

 i understand that <title> collins has made you an offer of marriage 	18.335012398025956

 elizabeth replied that it was 	37.43667929967516

 i have sir 	86.847754602742

 very well 	111.0400571099049

 we now come to the point 	46.038319859922346

 your mother insists upon your accepting it 	15.112940495247068

 is not it so <title> bennet 	29.54369994896739

 yes or i will never see her again 	36.86964964676703

 an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth 	14.236857698072354

 from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents 	26.467515963749168

 your mother will never see you again if you do not marry <title> collins and i will never see you again if you do  	15.98500294753802

 elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning 	22.607267977669682

 but <title> bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed 	16.907824998877107

 what do you mean <title> bennet by talking in this way 	19.526186746428102

 you promised me to insist upon her marrying him 	19.396926622807033

 my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request 	18.022616893820906

 first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion 	24.85757152735679

 and secondly of my room 	52.490596395510394

 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 	19.193127505767457

 not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did <title> bennet give up the point 	18.05044935084436

 she talked to elizabeth again and again 	32.895348626991016

 coaxed and threatened her by turns 	24.304877874815595

 she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering 	16.884668996694522

 and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 	11.714332384232614

 though her manner varied however her determination never did 	13.411169710537491

 <title> collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed 	10.271199422187365

 his regard for her was quite imaginary 	44.905449647477205

 and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret 	15.413669294433248

 while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them 	20.853926422102994

 she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning 	13.853369082352039

 <title> collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him 	20.587327215824676

 charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where <title> bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family 	13.733256559958724

 pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves 	11.828885391330775

 charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 	15.435173401176954

 aye there she comes continued <title> bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way 	12.079709008622991

 but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 	12.44741960855206

 i have done with you from this very day 	31.367847903871446

 not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body 	15.228053904534626

 people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 	13.380079139544728

 nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so 	27.242812571792122

 those who do not complain are never pitied 	27.083954666778844

 her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation 	8.675887605625821

 she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by <title> collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let <title> collins and me have a little conversation together 	14.393516269080537

 elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could 	13.733700356596582

 and charlotte detained first by the civility of <title> collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 	14.709853606106066

 in a doleful voice <title> bennet thus began the projected conversation 	15.052645924717067

 far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter 	9.686820767273725

 resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all 	18.023636842209022

 the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment 	15.131146361332735

 and i trust i am resigned 	50.6112941981871

 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand 	14.21347792217919

 for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation 	9.966162488714314

 you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and <title> bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf 	9.512257607123509

 my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own 	10.287209350289109

 i have certainly meant well through the whole affair 	21.306857088594942

 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise 	12.736880834150206

 the discussion of <title> collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother 	12.11938450961174

 as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence 	8.969595131451115

 he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend 	15.19125627454231

 the morrow produced no abatement of <title> bennet s ill humour or ill health 	11.86740394317253

 <title> collins was also in the same state of angry pride 	21.011147273634098

 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 	16.0591761462576

 after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if <title> wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball 	13.676210298751963

 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over 	13.706968756646623

 to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed 	20.49351733872379

 that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 	15.999388009398995

 his accompanying them was a double advantage 	23.756994350774068

 she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 	16.533465321799174

 soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet 	14.078668878914069

 it came from netherfield and was opened immediately 	29.378825030737403

 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand 	7.696181465423593

 and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 	16.086225651674173

 jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation 	15.605634660970402

 but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham 	13.048582243760972

 and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs 	12.016065719304029

 the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town 	15.87946456959235

 and without any intention of coming back again 	22.121755867301808

 you shall hear what she says 	37.09418264626088

 she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where <title> hurst had a house 	12.138595679084382

 but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 	11.313337733374544

 i depend on you for that 	44.71788212467953

 to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust 	11.002826546604833

 and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament 	15.466673604415972

 it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent <title> bingley s being there 	14.919556231491462

 and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his 	16.407745349270986

 it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country 	15.04150005559687

 but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters 	12.145523307409075

 <title> bingley will not be detained in london by them 	20.74693963452176

 caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter 	14.712792667233488

 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter 	24.394647182550518

 i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair 	20.12648746337729

 i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you 	11.486583392672173

 it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter 	15.023121777488473

 it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should  	19.621943413123333

 why will you think so 	52.8282156172151

 it must be his own doing 	48.67021461492373

 he is his own master 	62.94166939034311

 but you do not know all  	38.76233076775099

 <title> darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again 	15.202339521906106

 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments 	13.05040975909508

 and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 	10.439580876515498

 my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart 	11.316516595730457

 with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many 	11.192968840629355

 what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy 	24.04445865950157

 said jane as she finished it 	40.33834994510533

 is it not clear enough 	33.61836156029219

 does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister 	10.758505912282704

 that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard 	15.447636460085425

 can there be any other opinion on the subject 	21.33348564974866

 yes there can 	110.23036252153288

 for mine is totally different 	23.292251584352016

 most willingly 	166.4577261008578

 you shall have it in few words 	35.2804437981872

 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy 	19.436937310485742

 she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 	16.44932838389076

 jane shook her head 	34.40861282677217

 indeed jane you ought to believe me 	30.70340690422288

 no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection 	13.348322254795868

 miss bingley i am sure cannot 	33.264080135350326

 she is not such a simpleton 	49.791191976593026

 could she have seen half as much love in <title> darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes 	17.903818317842195

 but the case is this 	45.11782810694486

 we are not rich enough or grand enough for them 	15.20634745886836

 and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second 	14.201688741159373

 in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way 	14.71627159958792

 but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend 	14.100580067867558

 if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy 	14.594377067817337

 but i know the foundation is unjust 	33.03746663121704

 and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself 	26.376151541956105

 that is right 	67.48395121542622

 you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine 	14.789279407031582

 believe her to be deceived by all means 	27.23531940990097

 you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer 	15.15563983723214

 i did not think you would 	32.847927082842574

 and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion 	16.393636911123355

 but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required 	15.13385980652441

 a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 	11.606625995022979

 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect 	15.522274546146232

 but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together 	12.406364966957478

 after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that <title> bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses 	16.266206534906978

 chapter xxii 	674.9804741797982

 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to <title> collins 	13.932921072610876

 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 	19.756701492771207

 it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express 	22.370147749617775

 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 	19.877687192452516

 this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of 	15.421822454541225

 its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of <title> collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself 	12.838251349490157

 and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon 	13.467112593789524

 but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet 	12.644371029911342

 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise 	13.829182272640612

 for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday 	11.693901328306856

 his reception however was of the most flattering kind 	29.014252905871434

 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane 	14.262731082745468

 but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there 	15.594687723968704

 and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men 	14.232020510798595

 and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness 	15.493648940134511

 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance 	11.7744403686956

 and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained 	10.100381263119639

 sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent 	14.572437320015357

 and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity 	25.94110392082818

 <title> collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune 	14.005632888417285

 and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair 	13.53844387839851

 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer <title> bennet was likely to live 	12.94286855170548

 and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever <title> collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st 	12.893467140537375

 the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done 	12.433872515750295

 and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid 	10.954983997697806

 his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary 	23.190501602535008

 without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object 	13.837716119045593

 it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want 	8.391228643065423

 this preservative she had now obtained 	40.642857715832186

 and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it 	13.489740097785134

 the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 	15.316810073621472

 elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her 	16.004640531984816

 and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation 	19.042612702540758

 she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged <title> collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family 	15.086193916793475

 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty 	12.593415303531883

 for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love 	9.051145925475652

 and <title> bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them 	13.562204433110237

 my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive 	13.927525384595764

 and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible 	20.436551123810837

 they were all astonished 	53.69857529294702

 and <title> bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir 	10.922247704981872

 you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness 	8.59802883410909

 my dear sir replied <title> collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence 	12.423383886534918

 you cannot be too much on your guard 	23.17120252888366

 risk any thing rather than her displeasure 	36.606148152579955

 believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention 	11.777150259108183

 as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth 	9.87512050478521

 with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew 	17.383215873109066

 <title> bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 	15.000611641485365

 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others 	14.767430806341535

 there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion 	12.55275273050951

 but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away 	19.5691435847522

 the possibility of <title> collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two 	15.33660490185348

 but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to <title> collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach 	9.576921467164071

 though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza 	13.312221360860521

 do you think it incredible that <title> collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you 	15.34407930022216

 but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 	15.248999286235408

 i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as <title> collins was wishing to marry you 	15.267255280997162

 i am not romantic you know 	16.159468898139668

 i never was 	93.15360050255286

 i ask only a comfortable home 	32.35741664265454

 and considering <title> collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state 	12.00449116250208

 elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly 	42.75772332998823

 and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family 	15.513306631400857

 charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 	18.799772252399237

 it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match 	17.27481817119922

 the strangeness of <title> collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted 	11.429522101942275

 she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage 	12.274052028320671

 charlotte the wife of <title> collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 	14.203135232671642

 chapter xxiii 	674.9804741797982

 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family 	10.745282493341183

 with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous 	11.441885362912533

 for <title> bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story 	10.857462114164395

 do not you know that <title> collins wants to marry lizzy 	25.66206929488716

 nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment 	14.081636910887635

 but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all 	13.787095388205085

 and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy 	20.445207681556415

 elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself 	9.622411868819505

 and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of <title> collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london 	14.988542027685694

 <title> bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained 	15.611145204144268

 but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent 	15.446139456695503

 in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter 	13.081496706027627

 secondly she was very sure that <title> collins had been taken in 	32.989403829541544

 thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together 	27.258591919574165

 and fourthly that the match might be broken off 	29.34295219917355

 two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole 	12.022746283942103

 one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief 	33.44502444268818

 and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all 	18.655038032378325

 and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day 	11.21852904481311

 nothing could console and nothing appease her 	18.50578193590934

 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 	12.024445565514213

 <title> bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort 	15.031461773517746

 but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness 	24.673570850591844

 nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 	24.013640043085044

 and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton 	14.17388010288515

 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on <title> bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married 	12.86367603809838

 and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though <title> bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 	13.374841982650572

 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject 	12.245381017508432

 and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again 	14.409289685011387

 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return 	10.823080597251506

 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 	16.470185797942722

 the promised letter of thanks from <title> collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted 	13.311314932612852

 for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 	11.843794428279482

 <title> collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to <title> bennet 	14.174916696992943

 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband 	21.850015004886522

 it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge 	18.14218687837726

 it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome 	13.906548697384022

 she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 	14.795651307214262

 such were the gentle murmurs of <title> bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of <title> bingley s continued absence 	16.642571896609937

 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 	15.796211247748861

 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter 	14.238160580481534

 a report which highly incensed <title> bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood 	13.126808588241131

 even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away 	14.78762796860269

 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment 	16.27371665375039

 as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s 	11.060181404385427

 but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to 	15.65129678310945

 it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity 	9.89170380497361

 <title> collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction 	15.106043149035061

 he was too happy however to need much attention 	19.296021256170846

 and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company 	18.590167699711667

 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 	16.267218131071907

 <title> bennet was really in a most pitiable state 	26.83096920839815

 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of 	12.02170042713183

 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her 	18.328248789373745

 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 	13.542948644682074

 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession 	18.011005245388827

 and whenever she spoke in a low voice to <title> collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as <title> bennet were dead 	15.77704521686709

 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 	22.935364997324246

 indeed <title> bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts 	16.675544571682064

 let us hope for better things 	21.479889965729438

 let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor 	27.05051365583941

 this was not very consoling to <title> bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate 	18.237394373570492

 if it was not for the entail i should not mind it 	27.384280493330145

 what should not you mind 	63.24700863715638

 i should not mind any thing at all 	21.430018523311407

 let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility 	21.328629415081785

 i never can be thankful <title> bennet for any thing about the entail 	25.73302970646855

 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand 	14.195004485170237

 and all for the sake of <title> collins too why should he have it more than anybody else 	18.306861330916096

 i leave it to yourself to determine said <title> bennet 	21.241328553370945

 end of vol 	110.34112460188858

 <initial> illustration a vicarage house 	20.702130761906872

 pride and prejudice a novel 	23.437116849012558

 in three volumes 	39.901843535580845

 by the author of sense and sensibility 	15.302571682864418

 pride & prejudice 	63.151927974466496

 chapter <initial> miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt 	15.454519040931169

 the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country 	12.691281752750475

 and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort 	14.966295328834368

 miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it 	16.564864735772836

 her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 	10.210492354806528

 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of <title> darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 	12.388632213769943

 elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation 	16.15333704167427

 her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others 	14.128815064110574

 to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit 	13.589721431808279

 that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done 	20.168718955402067

 and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 	13.004317517581656

 had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best 	14.508879408477833

 but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself 	22.87793825047665

 it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing 	17.500022721216652

 whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation 	15.871009280332938

 whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded 	16.539961854022877

 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth 	15.597354663312975

 but at last on <title> bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself 	12.05269970420123

 she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him 	17.223719243909056

 but i will not repine 	50.36913440592152

 elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing 	13.710289080204797

 you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring 	16.77550876372436

 indeed you have no reason 	51.87517329764172

 he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all 	21.605155972972838

 thank god i have not that pain 	38.770668267561554

 a little time therefore 	48.09424052012878

 i shall certainly try to get the better 	19.155684820673436

 with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself 	14.782370784464197

 my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good 	18.58093599016527

 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic 	15.20819589716898

 i do not know what to say to you 	17.394457350912603

 i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve 	18.156731256321486

 miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection 	10.37657515261976

 nay said elizabeth this is not fair 	54.44206896519876

 you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body 	21.428133120065873

 i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it 	17.39978893885641

 you need not 	42.41169992289098

 there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well 	16.21754107977771

 and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense 	15.157491675619795

 i have met with two instances lately 	22.144044082805

 one i will not mention 	57.69966855130413

 the other is charlotte s marriage 	31.088684930094043

 it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these 	16.07749663259496

 they will ruin your happiness 	27.683181278458093

 you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper 	13.234609436558953

 consider <title> collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character 	15.860932732301887

 that as to fortune it is a most eligible match 	24.025335561802713

 and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 	13.86629524986929

 to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this 	15.912385171586815

 for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart 	19.743876433967444

 my dear jane <title> collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man 	12.492482580330183

 you know he is as well as i do 	27.327380905045942

 and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking 	15.498665464837055

 you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness 	8.627191266725651

 i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together 	14.662419773797962

 but enough of this 	68.61289667059891

 you alluded to something else 	28.278387242780358

 i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk 	12.35234034936881

 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 	15.568388183814585

 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect 	18.38217524914635

 it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us 	13.768218201843032

 women fancy admiration means more than it does 	18.649149034308337

 i am far from attributing any part of <title> bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth 	11.960461441609588

 but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery 	16.520897791098285

 thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business 	17.816419479097707

 and do you impute it to either of those 	25.38329212394908

 to the last 	59.76105664272875

 stop me whilst you can 	25.422068588156392

 you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him 	14.928686957554586

 yes in conjunction with his friend 	22.694968142579594

 i cannot believe it 	39.81219345884332

 why should they try to influence him 	21.98833886267962

 they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it 	17.305267472929884

 your first position is false 	19.070121516470646

 they may wish many things besides his happiness 	15.203243491077103

 they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence 	12.525137916961167

 they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride 	15.46693462274368

 beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane 	18.278505260698466

 but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing 	25.234925236790044

 no wonder if they love her better 	21.7068253903924

 but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother <initial> what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable 	13.2328802207743

 if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us 	17.94457076499979

 if he were so they could not succeed 	35.53277666967015

 by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy 	11.08186885334664

 do not distress me by the idea 	32.56469479713837

 let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood 	26.649122720808936

 elizabeth could not oppose such a wish 	34.84260876302844

 and from this time <title> bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 	17.016403072975027

 <title> bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 	13.429634143926878

 but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day 	17.15833582914208

 <title> bennet s best comfort was that <title> bingley must be down again in the summer 	20.747750352928946

 <title> bennet treated the matter differently 	29.3126517468385

 so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find 	16.005373565559495

 i congratulate her 	97.26472702726386

 next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then 	17.389267000558657

 it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions 	15.216416901456503

 when is your turn to come 	25.014501840762023

 you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane 	18.693545147666033

 now is your time 	56.01385869767767

 here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country 	16.272183585357098

 let wickham be your man 	32.650682454717284

 he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably 	14.997440092797495

 thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 	18.953013380277145

 we must not all expect jane s good fortune 	27.640546403145553

 true said <title> bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it 	14.647794098463745

 <title> wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family 	9.809861953026282

 they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve 	20.29804506750402

 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on <title> darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed 	16.35788316085172

 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire 	16.835571231409745

 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity <title> collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday 	13.529394715886617

 the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men 	12.579709310361112

 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before 	20.218400166706815

 wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks 	11.616428878246133

 on the following monday <title> bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn 	13.651376010692253

 <title> gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education 	16.714195116501486

 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable 	13.025336725651389

 <title> gardiner who was several years younger than <title> bennet and <title> philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces 	15.04609877616275

 between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard 	16.226416621222747

 they had frequently been staying with her in town 	23.027523319458123

 the first part of <title> gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions 	12.30136279079681

 when this was done she had a less active part to play 	21.658423824044398

 <title> bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of 	11.885584058990931

 they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister 	14.6587158846948

 two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it 	22.92163701781376

 i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got <title> bingley if she could 	18.83502670649878

 but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been <title> collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness 	17.857137955667234

 he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him 	24.1784849546426

 the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever 	17.658522481339993

 the lucases are very artful people indeed sister 	14.292054777891273

 they are all for what they can get 	35.09125930100664

 i am sorry to say it of them but so it is 	20.245221734946064

 it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else 	13.217853434407148

 however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves 	13.970724447597789

 <title> gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation 	16.19751508574221

 it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she 	18.017824456891788

 i am sorry it went off 	18.88293934700615

 an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us  	18.38253334680665

 we do not suffer by accident  	32.25839529339132

 but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea 	11.830347176840043

 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment 	13.876179100284418

 pray how violent was <title> bingley s love 	26.648245592342263

 he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her 	9.240384731960335

 at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer 	12.7852830874073

 could there be finer symptoms 	21.146783091690413

 is not general incivility the very essence of love 	14.74504423998414

 oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt 	30.28812647449087

 poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately 	22.15282153589933

 but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us 	20.999719745843198

 change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything 	14.218483558050172

 elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence 	17.72696558747686

 i hope added <title> gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her 	14.99452074673919

 we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her 	11.53348788214202

 for he is now in the custody of his friend and <title> darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it 	18.150042267225505

 <title> darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it 	10.460166875578446

 and depend upon it <title> bingley never stirs without him 	17.1593816775081

 i hope they will not meet at all 	26.17594712883346

 but does not jane correspond with the sister 	31.610403920578626

 she will not be able to help calling 	25.93505221482327

 but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 	13.465895073253678

 it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions 	15.261013385899659

 and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him 	15.277656051070958

 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn 	16.3310402944747

 and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement 	19.49407928193479

 <title> bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 	15.785767084836577

 and on these occasions <title> gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both 	10.827029475990276

 without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy 	16.338104645765185

 and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 	15.55114523791809

 to <title> gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers 	13.445595550874252

 about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged 	14.59288067263535

 <title> gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late <title> darcy by character perfectly well 	13.50497522639356

 in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself 	10.778200127280796

 on being made acquainted with the present <title> darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard <title> fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy 	12.193427031943653

 chapter iii 	389.700158465448

 <title> gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone 	16.339857754841066

 and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly 	24.380996034170057

 seriously i would have you be on your guard 	34.94655395108516

 do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent 	14.761280634920395

 i have nothing to say against him  	27.269924530799713

 he is a most interesting young man 	23.35054827122238

 and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better 	21.843771931147675

 but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you 	17.35629254360994

 you have sense and we all expect you to use it 	21.70534464974212

 your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure 	16.015294501435125

 you must not disappoint your father 	20.01130721759112

 my dear aunt this is being serious indeed 	18.964055929530417

 yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise 	31.954980850301844

 well then you need not be under any alarm 	22.83758650512717

 i will take care of myself and of <title> wickham too 	25.388549448507995

 he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it 	28.310150253889248

 elizabeth you are not serious now 	37.074304249715986

 i beg your pardon 	28.313668019764414

 i will try again 	46.43931096789344

 at present i am not in love with <title> wickham 	24.60668668690693

 no i certainly am not 	32.960405564737876

 but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not 	15.437031933049154

 i see the imprudence of it 	30.197717458529645

 oh that abominable <title> darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour 	20.493350967190995

 my father however is partial to <title> wickham 	20.49881724694099

 in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy 	23.280247890981524

 all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry 	20.90729137923251

 i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object 	18.537845267674015

 when i am in company with him i will not be wishing 	24.894350972825887

 perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often 	23.138714243727517

 at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him 	15.742447070257851

 as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile 	28.593975044822006

 very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that  	14.87220794048672

 but do not imagine that he is always here so often 	25.778828917451484

 it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week 	18.452646197389765

 you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends 	19.79120525190965

 but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest 	25.16891962941103

 and now i hope you are satisfied 	45.360328889405494

 her aunt assured her that she was 	20.747433433602346

 and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted 	18.670675253733613

 a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented 	12.503612648112732

 <title> collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane 	17.6990940880365

 but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to <title> bennet 	17.270152782287123

 his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy 	16.17142621942315

 thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit 	18.836533311584233

 as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza 	16.074645638986123

 that you certainly shall 	58.01760481524318

 and i have another favour to ask 	21.43460107369162

 we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire 	23.50274339256094

 i am not likely to leave kent for some time 	16.340476313364377

 promise me therefore to come to hunsford 	26.216136079015392

 elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit 	18.92982929346596

 my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party 	17.98316442889697

 the wedding took place 	32.80310432393738

 the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual 	14.885406667862542

 elizabeth soon heard from her friend 	41.60081601129092

 and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been 	14.813361854280576

 that it should be equally unreserved was impossible 	21.63538423573791

 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was 	14.720330196546534

 charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness 	20.81741670289354

 there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be 	16.014086476933578

 though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen 	16.178365303169592

 she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise 	10.809451428011872

 the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging 	14.485804663771153

 it was <title> collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened 	16.0743696719304

 and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest 	20.8714220593804

 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london 	14.063318790733614

 and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys 	22.21606542662271

 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is 	13.46913780722786

 jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline 	15.052814677331243

 she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost 	16.703697145767197

 my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street 	14.834663845747832

 she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley 	18.43196915635077

 i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london 	13.59046454411022

 i was right therefore 	56.12272885696572

 my last letter had never reached her 	30.41986427960918

 i enquired after their brother of course 	25.250958119670006

 he was well but so much engaged with <title> darcy that they scarcely ever saw him 	22.66989366141381

 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner 	30.997973530687567

 i wish i could see her 	27.622994448099796

 i dare say i shall soon see them here 	17.97459685091234

 it convinced her that accident only could discover to <title> bingley her sister s being in town 	14.899399082767365

 four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him 	23.28640331519727

 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it 	21.585050581398896

 but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention 	19.570071375989865

 but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer 	13.921219320923523

 the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt 	19.588599463471745

 my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me 	12.107438751892238

 but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion 	11.207439601886819

 i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again 	15.317966781833942

 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday 	21.00177491043932

 and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time 	19.73604745273941

 when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it 	23.855497841842876

 she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer 	12.882569138630174

 i pity though i cannot help blaming her 	24.648037933875237

 she was very wrong in singling me out as she did 	15.88442701834235

 i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side 	14.32749819569392

 but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it 	16.914580727021473

 i need not explain myself farther 	25.17841048048874

 and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me 	15.670393503785624

 and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable 	13.58289220733358

 i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago 	13.654613028302894

 and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy 	16.269543633064437

 if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this 	13.480370793331643

 let me hear from you very soon 	23.29849914492742

 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty 	17.067436713469643

 we had better not mention it 	33.199517636071235

 pray go to see them with sir william and maria 	28.933353412546417

 i am sure you will be very comfortable there 	21.174764304455756

 your s & <initial> this letter gave elizabeth some pain 	12.322450417341

 but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least 	16.604850391138772

 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over 	24.620086865939577

 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 	23.918840749747208

 his character sunk on every review of it 	14.641713119639094

 and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry <title> darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away 	14.552157303064094

 <title> gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information 	14.457914448765369

 and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 	14.902934353336235

 his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else 	11.902301316394842

 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain 	21.14224863887264

 her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it 	11.30391129118781

 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable 	13.60828465175198

 but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 	15.169643948962818

 nothing on the contrary could be more natural 	30.305056585841513

 and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy 	10.733878636321274

 all this was acknowledged to <title> gardiner 	32.3560809388143

 and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love 	14.578919608852832

 for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil 	9.626709273856001

 but my feelings are not only cordial towards him  	22.862303513528573

 they are even impartial towards miss king 	15.3555142186143

 i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl 	19.386668358582014

 there can be no love in all this 	23.32320202641022

 my watchfulness has been effectual 	40.80262130198314

 and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance 	16.59389291500244

 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do 	14.97096152127657

 they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain 	17.30771347290789

 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away 	7.393868948456212

 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford 	53.069975913327944

 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither 	17.61220934856648

 but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 	12.962940643498134

 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of <title> collins 	10.57564121015445

 there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 	14.938867300453063

 and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay 	20.579358717879924

 every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch 	13.489138080952795

 she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 	21.798536552311795

 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be 	11.912121290583077

 the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter 	18.54775729280593

 the farewell between herself and <title> wickham was perfectly friendly 	23.86610075452493

 on his side even more 	28.76501262184857

 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired 	16.33531161769051

 and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard 	11.731094950617877

 her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable 	16.334948696076342

 sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise 	11.741494809017757

 elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long 	17.63447509279444

 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood 	21.479722316391133

 and his civilities were worn out like his information 	13.319101636791087

 it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon 	13.213240689653746

 as they drove to <title> gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival 	14.819837016361241

 when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever 	12.458266977201331

 the day passed most pleasantly away 	20.679042954371

 the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres 	18.177928764701512

 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 	23.413074906849147

 their first subject was her sister 	35.58750368848991

 and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection 	10.671702666503641

 it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long 	22.209957112122392

 <title> gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance 	11.576756100561726

 <title> gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well 	9.345891454146559

 but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king 	17.194253204629515

 i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 	19.430095607553927

 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive 	16.37653870091957

 last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent 	20.415567741707225

 and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary 	16.04156865161318

 she is a very good kind of girl i believe 	20.39176042163062

 i know no harm of her 	21.223447550284057

 no why should he 	46.06163978356054

 if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor 	13.999587630596615

 but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event 	14.730367706882832

 a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe 	11.355981033174706

 if she does not object to it why should we  	23.036430559879765

 her not objecting does not justify him  	20.540946229685858

 it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling 	11.782804643537514

 well cried elizabeth have it as you choose 	42.85149094768609

 he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish 	35.647697134503936

 i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire 	14.815786742064503

 oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire 	21.74739394512996

 and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better 	19.892113574678

 i am sick of them all 	26.058065543539033

 thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 	13.60899563071565

 stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all 	17.46702590966792

 take care lizzy 	91.77911586458369

 that speech savours strongly of disappointment 	12.602194343703086

 before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 	15.138781075054371

 we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said <title> gardiner but perhaps to the lakes 	17.060792278059555

 no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful 	20.79803020062364

 my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour 	9.260527768912189

 adieu to disappointment and spleen 	31.248366062762425

 what are men to rocks and mountains 	14.415752982033604

 oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing 	12.781471734763109

 we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen 	18.21627851690814

 lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations 	13.975293315164937

 nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation 	9.202538229400586

 let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers 	11.214589516781464

 chapter <initial> every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth 	12.364643417027555

 and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment 	23.812353517835145

 for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight 	16.420183923447585

 when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view 	15.494868969541779

 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side 	11.093720704342385

 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 	27.970398217576236

 at length the parsonage was discernible 	18.54940475199052

 the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving 	14.142468410448016

 <title> collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 	13.112643234774863

 in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other 	18.18867991807005

 <title> collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received 	17.299350095632526

 she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage 	23.05622954319422

 his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family 	12.167193545822801

 they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house 	14.159441666647421

 and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment 	10.341228905629691

 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory 	33.001653640187634

 and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 	12.891032079390706

 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance 	13.671076732473242

 and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion 	16.65861834388857

 when <title> collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte 	11.566661318242557

 once or twice she could discern a faint blush 	13.529946410054881

 but in general charlotte wisely did not hear 	23.688909546817488

 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london <title> collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself 	14.400541712522351

 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures 	23.53835341103876

 and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible 	11.792385819782972

 here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind 	7.558401936645327

 he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump 	13.623302802491962

 but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 	12.905839677920797

 from his garden <title> collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back 	10.759373783579123

 and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help 	12.959839147766203

 it was rather small but well built and convenient 	12.061457578463493

 and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit 	13.780082939979051

 when <title> collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten 	15.432170496156461

 it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when <title> collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her 	12.64779775995811

 she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over 	14.807021155344309

 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here 	12.97970628544927

 we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home 	15.365640134459946

 her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us 	10.222191300289111

 i should say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several 	21.693801382675446

 lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour 	16.020802121533595

 very true my dear that is exactly what i say 	22.298385988198305

 she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference 	16.334985608807994

 the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written 	10.155717076071976

 and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 	11.19282991178336

 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of <title> collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings 	8.830087740186132

 about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion 	15.662856905576172

 and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her 	10.556824810766615

 she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is 	11.309986937518083

 make haste and come down this moment 	14.192683124152078

 elizabeth asked questions in vain 	26.96969130420525

 maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder 	12.276182550314163

 and is this all 	58.91375464528859

 cried elizabeth 	129.98188238015902

 i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine 	13.115728545679614

 the old lady is <title> jenkinson who lives with them 	14.239635916136136

 only look at her 	33.961654393256936

 she is quite a little creature 	50.540659226538864

 who would have thought she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind 	14.508239930442928

 why does she not come in 	34.638827553182956

 oh charlotte says she hardly ever does 	20.33400302859269

 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in 	11.815940974806052

 i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas 	22.94411495269525

 she looks sickly and cross 	23.533668205892415

 yes she will do for him very well 	45.50719543681942

 she will make him a very proper wife 	41.676715212608656

 <title> collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies 	15.46081596482434

 and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way 	10.103451878135559

 at length there was nothing more to be said 	28.74536625044147

 <title> collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day 	10.767575190859134

 chapter vi 	389.700158465448

 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for 	13.255903252477083

 i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings 	14.310178639717524

 i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen 	25.147989532432774

 but who could have foreseen such an attention as this 	22.208391515863934

 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 	10.240881530331349

 about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon 	13.748155895904414

 scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings 	18.813411083824363

 <title> collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them 	12.71990464358355

 when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel 	14.33177408568168

 lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter 	9.161870924487626

 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more 	14.62416908892609

 lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed 	20.397552416669424

 she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved 	20.500321246397842

 while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 	12.841189936274313

 such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st 	13.6430425985667

 james <initial> as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park 	14.007108434450199

 every park has its beauty and its prospects 	16.22300185239872

 when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 	12.660588351632281

 elizabeth s courage did not fail her 	30.451597881648624

 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation 	9.848284269728744

 from the entrance hall of which <title> collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and <title> jenkinson were sitting 	10.351342301133265

 her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them 	14.993915764330652

 and as <title> collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary 	16.788302653005413

 in spite of having been at st 	28.823654149748936

 james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word 	12.371117737714636

 and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look 	15.578692246746506

 lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome 	12.53060143070895

 her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank 	14.543593414023002

 she was not rendered formidable by silence 	17.884881646878878

 but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought <title> wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind 	11.06672243557529

 when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of <title> darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small 	13.09402612026085

 there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies 	11.870355628657247

 her features though not plain were insignificant 	18.551111819274972

 and she spoke very little except in a low voice to <title> jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes 	12.667951568361897

 after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view <title> collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 	12.819800610118383

 and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyship s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater 	13.513155068911098

 he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity 	9.419250225424147

 and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 	11.416732318908563

 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 	9.725261410711012

 the party did not supply much conversation 	27.2835127399313

 <title> jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed 	9.881240874336665

 maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 	18.990457614595485

 when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted 	14.706299957895238

 she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all 	11.124108205548962

 told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 	18.13153291223463

 elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others 	12.518943071872359

 in the intervals of her discourse with <title> collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to <title> collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl 	13.085840932012301

 she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name 	13.542081969209711

 lady catherine then observed your father s estate is entailed on <title> collins i think 	13.677947396490412

 for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it 	17.409233081330513

 but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line 	14.867670204168522

 do you play and sing miss bennet 	17.001030628171158

 a little 	79.89937253794784

 oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you 	23.770088712768114

 do your sisters play and sing 	21.56976840367444

 one of them does 	86.0687168265629

 why did not you all learn 	53.85340675819726

 you ought all to have learned 	55.15159732808342

 the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your <initial> do you draw 	15.253215583389224

 no not at all 	32.46662233334849

 what none of you 	53.00198485176901

 not one 	136.24445871755543

 that is very strange 	47.594416576225946

 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 	20.482682472325106

 my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london 	24.94252813867717

 has your governess left you 	17.410682683726616

 we never had any governess 	64.33707907680854

 no governess how was that possible 	27.40428154554847

 five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing 	15.81753260377194

 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education 	21.474908652088242

 elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case 	21.436357475476044

 then who taught you 	29.194542046577542

 who attended to you 	45.9181962256741

 without a governess you must have been neglected 	28.385245919145778

 compared with some families i believe we were 	29.626929399182835

 but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means 	14.703359071804616

 we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary 	17.937852088331685

 those who chose to be idle certainly might 	27.32002038271371

 aye no doubt 	122.88305801308341

 but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one 	13.476448037571226

 i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it 	11.233619812912456

 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way 	14.085114989594675

 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out 	16.754253473150946

 four nieces of <title> jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means 	12.3810290937851

 and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her 	16.79333262343483

 <title> collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me 	10.937832762084948

 she finds miss pope a treasure 	14.211031275285434

 lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure 	29.414789105710927

 are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet 	22.338343618655127

 yes ma am all 	52.58680641921109

 all what all five out at once 	11.883230067329947

 very odd and you only the second 	25.982763617673296

 the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young 	15.038577483555317

 yes my youngest is not sixteen 	48.95317196469895

 perhaps she is full young to be much in company 	32.997965026362955

 but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early 	14.199638127065379

 the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first 	14.824376221081613

 and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind 	15.306942822738021

 upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person 	12.315804156122212

 with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 	11.94473301721769

 lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 	10.185058054994288

 and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence 	17.752069977340287

 you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age 	16.52847257626253

 i am not one and twenty 	23.025067304078974

 when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed 	13.624965395175463

 lady catherine sir william and <title> and <title> collins sat down to quadrille 	19.917657430301766

 and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting <title> jenkinson to make up her party 	11.884169030148037

 their table was superlatively stupid 	18.708676637480607

 a great deal more passed at the other table 	21.903942025753963

 <title> collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many 	10.512469301169974

 sir william did not say much 	37.84390803217631

 he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names 	9.432385826942443

 when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to <title> collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered 	12.059456341614387

 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on <title> collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed 	13.396431597801973

 as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was 	16.03289207951567

 but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy <title> collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands 	12.48673627249588

 but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with 	16.501000819853658

 while sir william was with them <title> collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country 	11.270070223267142

 but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road 	14.183589055644571

 the room in which the ladies sat was backwards 	27.45147617505508

 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use 	12.661938895671387

 it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect 	19.935373658907995

 but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for <title> collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively 	17.87503597426871

 and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement 	32.22326702161042

 from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to <title> collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day 	12.315432350651546

 very few days passed in which <title> collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 	21.06611041039859

 and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 	13.938422310580155

 now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 	15.839848482230286

 she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently 	14.760419435888103

 and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that <title> collins s joints of meat were too large for her family 	12.262295242993412

 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <title> collins 	15.543205137829709

 and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty 	7.250713316253299

 the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week 	11.395896554997332

 and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 	14.675861924404133

 their other engagements were few 	26.26015437467292

 as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach 	19.352667205756017

 this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough 	16.150637029028108

 there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 	15.942235127446319

 her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity 	10.419927390388484

 in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 	18.04686548001202

 easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important 	16.95983984577501

 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that <title> darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine 	13.514992050012527

 who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself 	14.55465741132703

 and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence 	17.07989073549147

 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects 	10.965429274046196

 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for <title> darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when <title> collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him 	14.0246742705366

 charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility 	12.139907237813949

 <title> darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me 	15.172397502193185

 elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 	10.779483102760919

 <title> darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to <title> collins 	12.740374478990981

 and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure 	21.02741522218901

 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly 	13.459693577395475

 but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to <title> collins sat for some time without speaking to any body 	14.04404114904477

 at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family 	14.724356362521274

 have you never happened to see her there 	22.01810570586137

 she was perfectly sensible that he never had 	28.95949575271487

 but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane 	14.633112320649795

 and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet 	16.94921281572068

 the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 	16.828259405871968

 chapter viii 	389.700158465448

 colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings 	18.14262341885336

 it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary 	13.60148939811262

 and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 	12.548129545039753

 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 	21.438229232217903

 colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but <title> darcy they had only seen at church 	19.167408101642902

 the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room 	12.43172798160944

 her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else 	12.80610529594817

 and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room 	14.304753257585311

 any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings 	26.186610459648083

 and <title> collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 	10.821384423620103

 and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of <title> darcy 	12.331246541619434

 and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam 	14.863563926221095

 what is it you are talking of 	33.854818057260246

 let me hear what it is 	25.891577638388227

 we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply 	17.511982168909537

 of music then pray speak aloud 	11.762294105291437

 it is of all subjects my delight 	24.696318436649054

 there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste 	12.211555057847539

 if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient 	26.14498363353987

 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 	21.84652296317901

 how does georgiana get on darcy 	21.268140561460612

 <title> darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency 	21.782746132153807

 i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine 	18.8606603486759

 and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal 	15.981882721678362

 i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice 	18.90944774095839

 she practises very constantly 	37.453830271029446

 it cannot be done too much 	32.16516159092258

 and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account 	18.359035472321345

 i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice 	12.753226403117147

 i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more 	13.651391790475548

 and though <title> collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in <title> jenkinson s room 	15.350725809158025

 she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house 	20.138923967480828

 <title> darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer 	14.785408293691937

 when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him 	14.999300767396482

 he drew a chair near her 	18.881579396787775

 lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew 	17.568859484804833

 elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me <title> darcy by coming in all this state to hear me 	14.832259932157156

 but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well 	15.775198792169236

 there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others 	16.525745649419928

 my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me 	11.16171007808853

 i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you 	16.138980153188715

 and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own 	13.1775954978439

 elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say 	15.766500689558432

 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit 	14.210576324532365

 i am not afraid of you said he smilingly 	23.958341044914473

 pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam 	15.719339958285248

 i should like to know how he behaves among strangers 	20.34207588638362

 you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful 	11.923287353215784

 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did 	17.186519550144634

 he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce 	12.653924946838165

 and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner 	18.069173852777308

 <title> darcy you cannot deny the fact 	21.323917241976133

 i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party 	20.009933162977227

 and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room 	25.3494222490364

 well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next 	23.550593133666116

 my fingers wait your orders 	21.606428611869976

 perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers 	12.75739308126561

 shall we ask your cousin the reason of this 	12.653716037813691

 said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam 	20.8077478206869

 shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers 	12.263388207081515

 i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him 	10.499804083462728

 it is because he will not give himself the trouble 	25.30880664573467

 i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before 	11.13931606108223

 i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done 	13.359315890080653

 my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do 	15.723209758721413

 they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression 	19.45776460292564

 but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising 	20.946368003913495

 it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution 	13.245606272195639

 darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right 	29.517095197572

 you have employed your time much better 	22.315073000283988

 no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting 	21.0851691007205

 we neither of us perform to strangers 	24.54176482948805

 here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of 	18.693160636879018

 elizabeth immediately began playing again 	29.231613662070313

 lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master 	16.20625931400545

 elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise 	17.83497032327212

 but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love 	13.917809160464953

 and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation 	16.55418353496844

 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste 	9.699949926180379

 elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility 	25.84101826368016

 and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home 	16.82143355619349

 chapter ix 	389.700158465448

 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while <title> collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor 	14.106460263972103

 as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise <title> darcy and <title> darcy only entered the room 	12.534205093646184

 he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 	14.154841111896635

 they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 	10.498802938982912

 it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november <title> darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to <title> bingley to see you all after him so soon 	12.701372779848315

 for if i recollect right he went but the day before 	19.602874790807544

 he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london 	26.912335155029584

 perfectly so i thank you 	22.710482289622732

 she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that <title> bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again 	16.85597244182959

 i have never heard him say so 	24.267271668312187

 but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 	22.346797131675523

 he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 	15.259055869759829

 if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there 	15.870110564727183

 but perhaps <title> bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle 	22.44007400625492

 i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers 	17.56333385538903

 elizabeth made no answer 	29.630292405337062

 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend 	23.226320933290086

 and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him 	16.665680557359494

 he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house 	17.159894387008787

 lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when <title> collins first came to hunsford 	18.599731337850024

 i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 	16.176949355695058

 <title> collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife 	19.733448986016793

 yes indeed 	342.33724922115056

 his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had 	15.197773404297452

 my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying <title> collins as the wisest thing she ever did 	15.49175892392676

 she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her 	16.524447893425272

 it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends 	18.145456271743207

 an easy distance do you call it 	21.627641778129483

 it is nearly fifty miles 	24.827430491732407

 and what is fifty miles of good road 	24.630688154637916

 little more than half a day s journey 	23.38743508456581

 yes i call it a very easy distance 	37.17795393903908

 i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth 	18.07435986386666

 i should never have said <title> collins was settled near her family 	20.326643125147864

 any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far 	16.562846691946923

 as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood 	17.80514374247697

 the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances 	15.071098655947722

 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil 	11.339575232905133

 but that is not the case here  	43.44467693210387

 <title> and <title> collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance 	12.325594282563715

 <title> darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment 	17.117555745932854

 you cannot have been always at longbourn 	34.47109493353481

 elizabeth looked surprised 	95.10848622262776

 the gentleman experienced some change of feeling 	18.096550270149685

 he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent 	12.452394013185646

 a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk 	11.39038215701034

 the tête à tête surprised them 	13.65974031804906

 <title> darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away 	12.583324590629084

 what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone 	21.860703586793964

 my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way 	16.23514361782216

 but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case 	18.781242097899256

 and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year 	14.875488784070201

 all field sports were over 	14.242125917028773

 within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors 	14.350469446763409

 and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day 	15.794346794898438

 they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt 	13.229728931500192

 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more 	15.094584503337796

 and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham 	17.687227949760217

 and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind 	12.70890147966984

 but why <title> darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand 	25.283617924256053

 it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips 	12.146086291637554

 and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself 	11.833255241331232

 he seldom appeared really animated 	24.569145014777167

 <title> collins knew not what to make of him 	21.204726397763405

 colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her 	16.43166101771167

 and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out 	13.548529209726452

 she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford 	17.523265287200438

 but without much success 	71.3327277170662

 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable 	18.53868242574715

 it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 	12.28506688557043

 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea 	16.372047616175124

 and <title> collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment 	12.870934907724816

 in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam 	11.705488504876694

 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man 	19.340662300360677

 he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible 	21.850267739281463

 but to counterbalance these advantages <title> darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all 	14.285291122176613

 chapter <initial> more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet <title> darcy 	15.226625581521924

 she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought 	13.13437866708752

 and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers 	12.325632521326442

 how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third 	17.290625667337746

 it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her 	10.278146016650629

 he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much 	13.365740731241658

 but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of <title> and <title> collins s happiness 	12.32518271328688

 and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too 	14.363841737975816

 his words seemed to imply it 	23.317380894556642

 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts 	24.299704025587282

 she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter 	17.44131970573469

 it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage 	19.15807997956983

 she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by <title> darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her 	10.947734883730124

 putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way 	16.077401137386936

 are you going much farther 	22.622387126797484

 no i should have turned in a moment 	28.399976030989798

 and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together 	22.823803529766508

 but i am at his disposal 	33.90978702953741

 he arranges the business just as he pleases 	24.87193478823645

 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than <title> darcy 	12.319995434878951

 he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam 	20.29305658463458

 but so we all do 	41.41145949426571

 it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor 	14.807385590710576

 i speak feelingly 	116.52465457385789

 now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence 	13.485325553653945

 when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for 	12.6137979692638

 but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money 	14.284750732470043

 younger sons cannot marry where they like 	14.272193875256287

 unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do 	18.51192768507416

 our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 	10.661530769242596

 is this thought elizabeth meant for me 	16.264663858353128

 and she coloured at the idea 	36.11401501154639

 but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son 	13.758455154476056

 unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds 	14.25111870962254

 he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped 	35.683017296566966

 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 	10.20310573312064

 but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her 	16.329494968152456

 no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me 	18.271944474968652

 i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy 	19.95885263084643

 are you indeed 	70.37516646784907

 young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way 	14.611980138151244

 as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth 	12.373435526579879

 she directly replied you need not be frightened 	22.266411319690064

 i never heard any harm of her 	15.564536325210033

 and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world 	15.597166445618633

 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance <title> hurst and miss bingley 	15.904800658848144

 i think i have heard you say that you know them 	25.191080047913466

 i know them a little 	45.799359739120604

 their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy <initial> oh yes said elizabeth drily <title> darcy is uncommonly kind to <title> bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him 	12.70463290456721

 care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care 	11.862673092485155

 from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him 	17.963008366488406

 but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant 	19.058458056065625

 it was all conjecture 	49.318185860660726

 what is it you mean 	39.8295790284597

 and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley 	22.875091244208107

 what he told me was merely this 	24.765872763184195

 did <title> darcy give you his reasons for this interference 	23.92795644994048

 and what arts did he use to separate them 	17.259011798815266

 he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling 	22.184149250933842

 elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation 	16.529764180901623

 after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful 	21.98471421572549

 i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she 	21.620846301767354

 why was he to be the judge 	37.34334227475663

 you are rather disposed to call his interference officious 	17.97763142829425

 but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him 	18.458516056031616

 it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case 	21.475186427433247

 that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly 	12.392683958043193

 this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of <title> darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer 	17.621004552541642

 there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard 	17.28807852261357

 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected 	18.417378538311564

 there could not exist in the world two men over whom <title> darcy could have such boundless influence 	16.803633192626606

 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate <title> bingley and jane she had never doubted 	18.23912995047768

 but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them 	13.490998197692981

 if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer 	15.749045046732283

 he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world 	16.735409175535445

 and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 	17.033381980841995

 there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london 	10.660237216128921

 to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection 	17.368857400156703

 all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating 	13.83520475340654

 neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which <title> darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach 	11.896215083734068

 when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with <title> darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense 	13.430007075589224

 and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see <title> darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea 	13.64299666787913

 <title> collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but <title> collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home 	14.856940322356648

 chapter xi 	389.700158465448

 when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against <title> darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent 	14.919536199544773

 but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded 	13.28102217720509

 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal 	17.14867352837178

 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do 	14.73332117524863

 she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him 	17.618225810198226

 but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him 	18.785304999900486

 while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her 	13.68638056000313

 but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw <title> darcy walk into the room 	14.830603240622159

 in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 	13.934313311449003

 she answered him with cold civility 	30.24339558782535

 he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room 	14.61490861954737

 elizabeth was surprised but said not a word 	20.857562191995157

 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled 	15.121069739452315

 my feelings will not be repressed 	45.52102250515576

 elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression 	29.864086544866794

 she stared coloured doubted and was silent 	23.557604306664274

 this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed 	18.10274761164057

 he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride 	15.471239284273286

 his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit 	12.20770804463756

 in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive 	15.688016794690087

 till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger 	9.50215228458198

 she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done 	18.50323002510625

 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer 	15.255979225824069

 and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 	17.860939912142726

 as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 	25.33842255076625

 he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security 	14.769282519853451

 such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned 	11.671059281255086

 it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you 	15.227058595122495

 but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 	17.008046371084685

 it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration 	19.15548875271342

 the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation 	11.019463452942073

 <title> darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise 	12.545343101680801

 his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature 	14.480387486880058

 he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it 	14.664933638112895

 the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful 	34.3300630090383

 but it is of small importance 	26.875997987948942

 i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character 	9.876722015783564

 was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil 	16.61102868347329

 but i have other provocations 	42.901474633669096

 you know i have 	42.44842510332281

 had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister 	11.613672675676739

 as she pronounced these words <title> darcy changed colour 	21.3746589101212

 but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 	11.458810410227827

 i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 	20.572633414709635

 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there  	7.821761470241135

 you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind 	12.174545822093886

 she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 	11.496009062601797

 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity 	19.642215704081565

 she repeated 	414.5681615908366

 with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success 	15.76398149461802

 towards him i have been kinder than towards myself 	20.678942025994136

 elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her 	9.858729434464701

 but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded 	14.56571221490819

 long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided 	20.14125782871036

 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from <title> wickham 	17.881876915755463

 on this subject what can you have to say 	23.671138069115305

 in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself 	12.294297948120828

 or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others 	10.236903034835079

 you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour 	15.107772232833941

 who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him 	12.339116115848782

 his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously 	22.522034105650974

 yes his misfortunes have been great indeed 	28.49209237745099

 and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy 	26.880650672343943

 you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty 	18.162669950421225

 you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him 	17.278978397781895

 you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert 	17.300968403731147

 you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule 	15.123806756249419

 and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully 	14.845974426015392

 my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 	9.372189943049815

 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination 	7.704946526513149

 by reason by reflection by every thing 	14.068890844432733

 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 	25.36042524735902

 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related 	33.0411400833965

 they were natural and just 	33.008614178516396

 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections 	25.25886114310993

 to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own 	11.130415195470686

 elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment 	14.965294142982122

 yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken <title> darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	16.918665151897304

 she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it 	16.466659985476376

 again his astonishment was obvious 	18.97366159499565

 and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 	15.618277795521163

 she went on 	85.16702520729632

 from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike 	10.998928167250517

 you have said quite enough madam 	27.956135778711484

 i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been 	21.628629669813577

 forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness 	16.40586128947793

 and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house 	13.895681191855077

 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 	24.10223593279065

 she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour 	11.136740205688646

 her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it 	11.645117862391995

 that she should receive an offer of marriage from <title> darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection 	13.869506892701406

 but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned <title> wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited 	11.486388771402769

 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room 	12.241980562553959

 elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 	15.119455962963212

 it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 	10.06589723189548

 she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of <title> darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road 	12.891764878825953

 the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 	14.987566827942638

 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park 	14.392553477911518

 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees 	17.849138461536313

 she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park 	11.522720085758182

 he was moving that way 	28.261891377012038

 and fearful of its being <title> darcy she was directly retreating 	27.11166064158737

 but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name 	12.653520130488799

 she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be <title> darcy she moved again towards the gate 	14.887162933338821

 he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 	12.846726290196415

 will you do me the honour of reading that letter 	21.041112166418056

 and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight 	17.24458736516822

 with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand 	9.801516542442682

 the envelope itself was likewise full 	13.975926879014082

 pursuing her way along the lane she then began it 	19.297165142465186

 it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you 	9.688989092445421

 i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten 	10.891969828075156

 and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read 	14.837180692403287

 you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention 	13.707243555716966

 your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice 	18.789657484908453

 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge 	12.26968391984411

 the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached <title> bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of <title> wickham 	10.399852838226009

 wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison 	11.052914939246833

 but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read 	12.998953297172951

 if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry 	17.410634510847437

 i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country 	13.47302994723739

 but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment 	24.5202247196769

 he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided 	27.09247713595416

 from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively 	22.37542819387306

 and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him 	17.987817497425354

 your sister i also watched 	34.238241717708384

 her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment 	10.890444307784081

 if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error 	24.854724726353343

 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable 	25.209511978359934

 if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable 	13.854640432314511

 but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched 	12.777558678365766

 that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 	10.440621225291071

 i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it 	21.748987421258235

 i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason 	17.149249580519818

 my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case 	15.045588604343099

 the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 	21.355342528030615

 but there were other causes of repugnance 	22.1531067783088

 causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me 	9.023324697426832

 these causes must be stated though briefly 	22.839680343395376

 the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father 	10.049674820590855

 pardon me 	238.7430909249771

 it pains me to offend you 	30.399079531220586

 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both 	12.217811374688786

 i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 	11.834868587695372

 he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning 	19.16927020557458

 his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own 	16.704498526161895

 our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered 	23.92728392068807

 and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 	11.636143885498331

 i described and enforced them earnestly 	16.536464070869684

 but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference 	12.368583313375261

 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard 	16.824062564167765

 but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 	13.078295834161938

 to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point 	13.55858955114633

 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment 	12.033423554681518

 i cannot blame myself for having done thus much 	17.373590558587185

 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction 	18.668396568515934

 it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town 	13.24212895182459

 that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable 	15.038686091756

 it is done however and it was done for the best 	28.926375112976025

 on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer 	20.299110215595384

 if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done 	23.505755842310005

 and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them 	10.548572595715086

 but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity 	16.431448139597705

 <title> wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates 	18.20125037533006

 most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education 	16.510275866631797

 my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging 	21.37112661944649

 he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it 	15.452576645829009

 as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner 	20.097555061369484

 the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <title> darcy could not have 	11.75310081865084

 here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell 	16.873107801808388

 it adds even another motive 	23.287548811794174

 my excellent father died about five years ago 	13.196009845703985

 and his attachment to <title> wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant 	13.782234300103806

 there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds 	14.488461226110887

 his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events <title> wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited 	10.935942132120356

 i rather wished than believed him to be sincere 	24.787783046192626

 but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal 	18.000537408014186

 i knew that <title> wickham ought not to be a clergyman 	25.50673358373475

 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds 	15.154670720662416

 all connection between us seemed now dissolved 	14.798826688187424

 i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town 	14.351221151048021

 for about three years i heard little of him 	16.6899726677496

 his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad 	16.235578069971595

 he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions 	14.1481100718181

 you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it 	9.184968514012215

 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself 	16.632628026583024

 after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt 	18.108602342789705

 how he lived i know not 	28.00453256507986

 i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being 	13.703270668590095

 having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy 	20.891725390275205

 my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself 	15.749025874016436

 about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london 	15.854056465331468

 and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate 	19.725280058821795

 for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and <title> younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived 	13.12892124135817

 and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement 	12.995696948866955

 she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse 	21.111212259803352

 and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 	15.270580321338667

 i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me 	10.641094828391862

 you may imagine what i felt and how i acted 	26.747757763928973

 regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to <title> wickham who left the place immediately and <title> younge was of course removed from her charge 	14.4555983611104

 <title> wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds 	11.179325530559964

 his revenge would have been complete indeed 	24.052846974864135

 but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at 	30.893467531195846

 ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination 	15.318987000213179

 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 	15.929071112199344

 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed 	20.87827807523151

 for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions 	11.18052181362732

 if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin 	12.24069119979317

 and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 	16.171226801171898

 i will only add god bless you 	15.560541589904908

 fitzwilliam darcy 	178.2929202364926

 if elizabeth when <title> darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 	19.16473126631243

 but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited 	13.81633786151927

 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 	19.257088690519037

 and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal 	16.802933388492963

 she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 	11.749717708077322

 his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice 	16.918285733127714

 he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her 	15.599666158354204

 his style was not penitent but haughty 	23.439394282823027

 it was all pride and insolence 	31.134804997113736

 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of <title> wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition 	9.25006338591144

 astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her 	17.045176007227752

 she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again 	12.428394755835823

 in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on 	10.843255154586378

 but it would not do 	47.968408536815105

 in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence 	12.045951965246166

 the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself 	23.367652171847258

 and the kindness of the late <title> darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words 	16.99505047393657

 so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great 	14.242145187898961

 what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other 	14.460805816229314

 and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err 	18.063793666546815

 she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success 	13.75343684437378

 on both sides it was only assertion 	30.777044254939202

 but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render <title> darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole 	12.167449310596567

 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to <title> wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her 	11.811505948138628

 she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance 	13.77811161660418

 of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself 	20.36108168315051

 as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring 	18.33167106696479

 his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue 	17.387652682332856

 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of <title> darcy 	7.344206632969013

 or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what <title> darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance 	9.832194796378197

 but no such recollection befriended her 	21.675426493745828

 she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address 	19.538150727134038

 but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess 	16.087787457564957

 after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read 	15.102157562933169

 but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before 	12.71075153884104

 and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question 	15.081649495344202

 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that <title> darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration 	15.730662258829446

 she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at <title> philips <initial> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory 	16.957396733201215

 she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before 	15.401190097697901

 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct 	15.777795141988868

 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing <title> darcy that <title> darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground 	16.163841436299794

 she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself 	13.503465030207735

 but that after their removal it had been every where discussed 	19.540297790247973

 that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking <title> darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son 	12.231461812872437

 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary 	11.902721522117497

 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive 	23.504779331249527

 he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn 	11.669100493570614

 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter 	10.51708804616115

 and in farther justification of <title> darcy she could not but allow that <title> bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair 	12.677339858078913

 that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits 	10.6313536400674

 that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling 	14.102385187569409

 that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world 	11.439413694347232

 and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as <title> bingley was incomprehensible 	19.170258323997302

 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself 	24.268288329494787

 of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd 	10.31084713245098

 how despicably have i acted she cried 	18.164050974596545

 i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust 	8.895470208556942

 but vanity not love has been my folly 	21.878167947276804

 pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned 	12.790101372141

 till this moment i never knew myself 	33.312792710063796

 from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that <title> darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient 	15.40179616673226

 widely different was the effect of a second perusal 	39.62792096028427

 how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other 	16.842804244150884

 and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been 	12.857678984662472

 neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane 	20.520257326874198

 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe 	13.811421074185875

 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers 	14.316514870441276

 the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt 	36.35678497899056

 it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family 	17.25239488753849

 and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before 	11.652521964383546

 after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought 	12.98895788825111

 re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home 	11.89027710208345

 and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation 	13.051790112761047

 she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence 	14.695586431274535

 elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him 	14.845636834528495

 she really rejoiced at it 	27.04202756230728

 colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object 	25.615742770011057

 she could think only of her letter 	41.56631271271813

 chapter xiv 	389.700158465448

 and <title> collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings 	9.680207796810027

 and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 	13.864746858718798

 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece 	16.872831107952404

 what would she have said 	37.82927465666986

 how would she have behaved 	33.981970184629596

 were questions with which she amused herself 	19.402629255976926

 i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine 	14.31970645598872

 i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 	13.686069684976355

 but i am particularly attached to these young men 	18.27614697490363

 and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are 	19.993770645344984

 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last 	8.820853442932767

 but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year 	16.97240887145063

 his attachment to rosings certainly increases 	26.578565962833295

 <title> collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 	13.081428574663322

 <title> collins will be very glad of your company i am sure 	21.145962237911366

 i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it 	16.27770299595588

 i must be in town next saturday 	33.90459494248607

 why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks 	22.13654672718852

 i expected you to stay two months 	27.183066237905052

 i told <title> collins so before you came 	28.94698953430455

 there can be no occasion for your going so soon 	19.347945822237886

 <title> bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight 	17.515180063454007

 but my father cannot 	74.05066229501827

 oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can 	21.858140439047784

 daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 	23.387333864679896

 and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week 	14.178533186952688

 and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large 	14.421436487355711

 you are all kindness madam 	30.062059493300783

 lady catherine seemed resigned 	40.05677485204293

 <title> collins you must send a servant with them 	17.692440458384453

 you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves 	14.073037816867426

 it is highly improper 	43.683957017646215

 you must contrive to send somebody 	27.625900028772286

 i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 	20.283695584877442

 young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life 	10.93362561624413

 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her 	11.583126518156176

 miss darcy the daughter of <title> darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 	14.665402156849755

 i am excessively attentive to all those things 	21.82992661345345

 you must send john with the young ladies <title> collins 	18.5970166895287

 i am glad it occurred to me to mention it 	17.166672566689584

 my uncle is to send a servant for us 	24.684297875561597

 oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he 	17.589489699641092

 i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things 	15.340897743640134

 where shall you change horses 	24.46842978502645

 oh bromley of course 	40.27166859125645

 if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to 	19.320880852066917

 or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was 	15.529302990899414

 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours 	24.30407058222494

 whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief 	31.817315936066215

 and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections 	13.776240265173538

 <title> darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart 	18.681870705636975

 she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different 	14.01016499600095

 when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation 	22.315116482401276

 but she could not approve him 	31.061380646984727

 nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again 	11.46917713387254

 in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret 	14.100387503864361

 and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin 	17.56551009524344

 they were hopeless of remedy 	28.323038983151655

 her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters 	10.937054191923849

 and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil 	15.268363594693222

 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia 	13.384705934667315

 but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement 	14.843565820770008

 catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice 	9.447080976187408

 and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing 	11.412210240929115

 they were ignorant idle and vain 	23.548182692553304

 while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him 	20.440101152279553

 and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever 	16.27090339252221

 how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful 	11.075895176613987

 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first 	15.94725254302173

 the very last evening was spent there 	18.06661164203198

 and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh 	11.631664211012234

 when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year 	13.599474298576611

 and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 	11.454090358203825

 chapter xv 	389.700158465448

 on saturday morning elizabeth and <title> collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared 	15.739382602782044

 and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 	11.636339015037183

 i know not miss elizabeth said he whether <title> collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 	14.743756222249102

 the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you 	16.940686665901733

 we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode 	20.972777967722052

 our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself 	11.06686882115604

 but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly 	15.333843614687655

 elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 	20.778490995285583

 she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment 	19.73022219666731

 and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged 	20.464349251626373

 <title> collins was gratified 	40.98408443335878

 and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably 	14.110518582446815

 we have certainly done our best 	26.434888498382428

 you see on what a footing we are 	22.042438903547186

 in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings 	13.112822550370497

 words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings 	24.871556720604893

 and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 	14.488180803632059

 you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin 	16.590777521473033

 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so 	23.89045661571484

 lady catherine s great attentions to <title> collins you have been a daily witness of 	14.959264842443844

 and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent 	14.02557603471674

 only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage 	14.930678919621208

 my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 	19.493960974308866

 we seem to have been designed for each other 	19.295543526336246

 she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung 	18.128283267924882

 poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open 	23.787896336359907

 and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion 	15.64141854739709

 after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by <title> collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to <title> and <title> gardiner though unknown 	16.482059398609042

 he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings 	13.818640078647443

 the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off 	23.91996702492451

 good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh 	11.968411415433009

 we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal 	10.28095408954416

 their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm 	18.970570433556297

 and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached <title> gardiner s house where they were to remain a few days 	13.823280634058298

 jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 	13.495974502623246

 but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 	26.80279782978449

 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of <title> darcy s proposals 	14.207609739340919

 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate 	12.728156875577401

 and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther 	14.063006017202515

 chapter xvi 	389.700158465448

 it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire 	13.930350909096136

 and as they drew near the appointed inn where <title> bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs 	10.92620945851666

 these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber 	8.53430966887693

 after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice 	8.210191379964199

 is not this an agreeable surprise 	24.23524420565071

 and we mean to treat you all added lydia 	19.443219796776333

 but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there 	14.660661343129691

 i do not think it is very pretty 	23.910115315731016

 but i thought i might as well buy it as not 	23.278116995743396

 i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better 	15.6163764066112

 and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop 	12.93424636054534

 and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable 	11.74246187256979

 besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight 	14.09022011172966

 are they indeed 	77.35458664557089

 cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction 	43.12425241368322

 they are going to be encamped near brighton 	24.404363880452028

 and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all 	13.43580294488405

 mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once 	12.507836314638302

 now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table 	19.23161250338946

 what do you think 	35.31180068753836

 jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay 	21.218093814209883

 but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone 	21.54121456855209

 i never saw such a long chin in my life 	19.290902600282045

 well but now for my news it is about dear wickham 	25.605151907998803

 too good for the waiter is not it 	28.46252548267625

 there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king 	20.12422610650942

 there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool 	27.91560695904289

 gone to stay 	88.91840663542156

 wickham is safe 	85.32071373966798

 and mary king is safe added elizabeth 	17.38397281328482

 safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune 	31.35843904351944

 but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane 	14.222939988168628

 i am sure there is not on his  	23.203265076162193

 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her 	15.742160909809014

 who could about such a nasty little freckled thing 	15.523975131042532

 elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered 	11.014488897239891

 and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it 	9.732163949631136

 how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia 	14.574173719402294

 i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home 	9.351319756138022

 and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away 	16.35394422091126

 have you seen any pleasant men 	15.876631511035727

 have you had any flirting 	47.53942921187195

 i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 	19.323603188390546

 jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare 	16.494952284405016

 she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can not think 	10.688855633876504

 she says lizzy had better have taken <title> collins 	16.287837668838627

 but i do not think there would have been any fun in it 	16.292026138046896

 and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls 	19.610168707435164

 dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster <initial> kitty and me were to spend the day there and <title> forster promised to have a little dance in the evening 	15.442163081459809

 by the bye <title> forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself 	11.259279831208765

 and then what do you think we did 	25.37094077488365

 we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col 	11.115822767908952

 and <title> forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns 	16.741377885507625

 and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least 	14.14204541321918

 lord how i laughed and so did <title> forster 	23.314960242026153

 i thought i should have died 	36.960616469050954

 and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter 	17.318256146400344

 with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn 	9.394122995111283

 elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name 	16.195128857850694

 their reception at home was most kind 	28.98771599427235

 <title> bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty 	19.024792267777713

 and more than once during dinner did <title> bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy 	16.301256436469703

 their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them 	12.997925982371152

 lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter 	12.270142534073257

 <title> bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases 	12.753704434074617

 and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her 	13.253261189237355

 oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach 	13.594595909561734

 and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick 	17.736407905384084

 and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too 	13.158842144112375

 and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach 	17.78281242395647

 i was ready to die of laughter 	21.81485000974604

 and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures 	9.963525171478453

 but i confess they would have no charms for me  	21.87888379272008

 i should infinitely prefer a book 	20.952367424254042

 but of this answer lydia heard not a word 	18.644101532373686

 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on 	15.947353336345934

 but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme 	18.51979740794448

 she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 	19.196711187493403

 in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account 	15.584639292550289

 she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents 	13.564329647555343

 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding 	21.838420880204247

 but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 	9.454379531274695

 elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome 	13.969709070158073

 and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between <title> darcy and herself 	13.320408708889627

 miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural 	12.136021488245254

 and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings 	19.784199865869763

 she was sorry that <title> darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them 	14.481908777705367

 but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him 	18.52580480611144

 his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she 	14.547898228946757

 and certainly ought not to have appeared 	38.74856452215492

 but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 	23.48156925822939

 indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him 	27.108526785075252

 but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 	13.963896291497056

 you do not blame me however for refusing him 	17.661138954981844

 blame you oh no 	32.837060959456

 but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham 	14.949473058278556

 no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did 	18.8915842545577

 she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham 	16.425381884594554

 what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual 	9.80694175293093

 nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery 	16.631016541098145

 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other 	6.810973617391225

 this will not do said elizabeth 	39.77720104381831

 you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing 	20.444382196274216

 take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one 	18.749642833264762

 there is but such a quantity of merit between them 	15.266616974793411

 just enough to make one good sort of man 	21.688579596638167

 and of late it has been shifting about pretty much 	13.295227795894743

 for my part i am inclined to believe it all <title> darcy s but you shall do as you chuse 	20.25804267201923

 it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane 	14.801548278894854

 i do not know when i have been more shocked said she 	17.274796264529495

 wickham so very bad it is almost past belief 	25.05336038982968

 and poor <title> darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered 	22.93260603330775

 such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing 	18.28197911924672

 i am sure you must feel it so 	22.428602207664223

 i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 	11.754592952820607

 your profusion makes me saving 	20.773580284844254

 and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather 	14.737843034931782

 poor wickham 	411.35421514161044

 there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner 	17.41400490198998

 there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men 	17.191343209252246

 one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it 	23.524916086461218

 i never thought <title> darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 	22.222581205318566

 and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason 	14.558628535069053

 one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just 	19.631637809215125

 but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 	17.456096731803434

 lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 	16.491866703593193

 indeed i could not 	45.88910678953337

 i was uncomfortable enough 	45.206632056847646

 i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy 	25.193002761170668

 and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to <title> darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved 	12.339496629638228

 but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 	18.30809000455779

 there is one point on which i want your advice 	23.48867276946688

 i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character 	16.93556421462186

 miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 	13.698796819345931

 what is your own opinion 	58.19552725823802

 that it ought not to be attempted 	42.90267489614985

 <title> darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public 	19.222754092389305

 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself 	15.119068460195793

 the general prejudice against <title> darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light 	15.408559423818202

 i am not equal to it 	24.07740626394969

 wickham will soon be gone 	30.810169744957587

 and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is 	16.453935160827736

 sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before 	13.098061895527346

 at present i will say nothing about it 	17.892619305696822

 you are quite right 	45.37321821838901

 he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character 	14.124161193713489

 we must not make him desperate 	45.81703540486815

 the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation 	15.49449603593317

 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either 	16.114115510174216

 but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure 	11.831195980709927

 she dared not relate the other half of <title> darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend 	14.981185938905076

 here was knowledge in which no one could partake 	25.47558681139719

 and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery 	9.792400886069112

 and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 	12.944361988575269

 the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits 	12.615221895230107

 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley 	23.098548107173155

 having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast 	10.110542445200759

 and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity 	14.316881362899913

 for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody 	23.233135078208836

 i told my sister philips so the other day 	22.07720748075869

 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london 	21.893053784488774

 well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 	19.686766138701454

 there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer 	24.919164009041825

 and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know 	18.47242282344863

 i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more 	19.113162054899075

 oh well it is just as he chooses 	47.85761756891875

 nobody wants him to come 	42.51510702325768

 though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill 	20.36138638571517

 well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done 	15.66375288057636

 but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer 	16.00885320509072

 well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they 	13.934476349425584

 well well i only hope it will last 	30.61338605354464

 and what sort of table do they keep 	17.527598309613943

 charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say 	15.244972207169388

 if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough 	22.095384398588354

 no nothing at all 	34.14581768905349

 a great deal of good management depend upon it 	11.288126331797256

 yes yes 	488.4897515417537

 they will take care not to outrun their income 	21.403162414299302

 they will never be distressed for money 	25.746060847794414

 well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead 	13.32217761044249

 they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens 	16.321352291494055

 it was a subject which they could not mention before me 	24.188398473050253

 it would have been strange if they had 	19.65965839930929

 but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves 	18.91776944792493

 well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better 	19.456060593074696

 i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me 	19.537786266174045

 the first week of their return was soon gone 	26.78934116107583

 the second began 	95.32544597138971

 the dejection was almost universal 	25.817909863092872

 the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments 	9.70885352844659

 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family 	9.447655517214475

 how can you be smiling so lizzy 	20.28728546450348

 their affectionate mother shared all their grief 	19.401191106792158

 she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago 	11.649684970374839

 i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away 	8.464685452029574

 i thought i should have broke my heart 	20.270213501733632

 i am sure i shall break mine said lydia 	12.760761512895607

 if one could but go to brighton observed <title> bennet 	17.969705913665493

 a little sea bathing would set me up for ever 	9.96542958840317

 and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty 	14.796555315445275

 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house 	10.946370819227496

 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them 	32.02453691348649

 she felt anew the justice of <title> darcy s objections 	17.751745085421874

 and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend 	20.374532414341807

 but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away 	13.18411483680881

 for she received an invitation from <title> forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton 	19.420324923984086

 this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married 	21.538237466613605

 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two  	14.082753559441834

 the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of <title> forster the delight of <title> bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described 	14.501758266844197

 wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever 	10.216850338506422

 whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish 	11.551670144940916

 i cannot see why <title> forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend 	15.0606584218378

 in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned 	19.47037956309768

 as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter 	16.728022553541834

 and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go 	13.969606078774518

 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as <title> forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home 	13.214286741359029

 he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances 	14.384596469850798

 if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner 	15.556216177345076

 nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair 	17.305010887777755

 already arisen repeated <title> bennet 	19.243926127749134

 what has she frightened away some of your lovers 	28.262948971589545

 poor little lizzy but do not be cast down 	23.35637247684099

 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret 	13.973469385772372

 come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly 	15.445332146677217

 indeed you are mistaken 	58.45614487891379

 our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character 	12.572275499767294

 excuse me for i must speak plainly 	53.21354724894695

 if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment 	13.055970183324794

 her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous 	17.899145611143076

 a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation 	15.26173350646491

 without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person 	19.869870350731112

 vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace 	13.926150791863193

 <title> bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject 	22.72916076481359

 and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love 	14.451901001627343

 wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued 	21.162182505202882

 and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters 	12.13821655809501

 we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton 	18.092902641231703

 let her go then 	51.374708081866046

 colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief 	20.647642449550702

 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here 	15.60381672559787

 the officers will find women better worth their notice 	12.69836134006429

 let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance 	19.571570830130476

 at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life 	9.057629497644196

 it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them 	11.734017993644905

 she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition 	11.295349874353239

 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility 	13.451064552295461

 in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 	11.742212370201601

 she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers 	9.503627218513788

 she saw all the glories of the camp 	40.119884509691595

 and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once 	7.7621025271939175

 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations 	12.561799998091676

 they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same 	20.673712962703117

 lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself 	16.733628688590027

 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed 	25.907010445891142

 and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home 	16.29636790938236

 elizabeth was now to see <title> wickham for the last time 	36.885394132472356

 having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over 	12.863710737448656

 the agitations of former partiality entirely so 	11.468285440783742

 she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary 	11.141668599541113

 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry 	14.525334284429153

 and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and <title> darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former 	13.073907293318424

 he looked surprised displeased alarmed 	30.83601053270738

 but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often 	17.565747383265016

 and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him 	18.428608121777746

 with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings 	13.630250891722838

 nearly three weeks 	87.11856696726647

 yes almost every day 	52.862073388861

 his manners are very different from his cousin <initial> yes very different 	20.258366668291725

 but i think <title> darcy improves on acquaintance 	27.749795538367643

 indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her 	24.712054316797875

 and pray may i ask 	28.90804534309752

 but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves 	18.495180810551137

 has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style 	13.112089458516643

 for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials 	16.80352478222166

 oh no said elizabeth 	63.95379097332925

 in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was 	22.77965610283954

 while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning 	10.9313168598486

 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood 	12.030339287731582

 for a few minutes he was silent 	30.65029415428255

 till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards <title> darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right 	13.283505277496113

 his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by 	16.164422010309107

 i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe 	11.934561626566303

 his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together 	23.585699062034163

 and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart 	16.515952382817414

 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him 	18.40902579513922

 the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth 	15.493921236633685

 and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 	10.772561108972871

 when the party broke up lydia returned with <title> forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning 	12.279815771532661

 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic 	19.110851614730244

 kitty was the only one who shed tears 	28.34182729918243

 but she did weep from vexation and envy 	17.894478087073647

 <title> bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible 	13.40968119120715

 advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to 	26.14394749367697

 and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 	12.374427954071528

 chapter xix 	389.700158465448

 had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort 	12.656035971482417

 her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her 	9.30430147520105

 and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown 	20.206859019912656

 but <title> bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice 	11.625234028063973

 he was fond of the country and of books 	35.631441798890215

 and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments 	12.265750885440143

 to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement 	14.219802072146589

 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife 	19.414110693206297

 elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband 	24.182682585544985

 she had always seen it with pain 	31.13925748100236

 but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents 	9.880193200839607

 talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife 	9.485485780771313

 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment 	16.420136792463477

 their parties abroad were less varied than before 	11.427923391486733

 and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle 	11.37763962653582

 and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp 	10.107384805229772

 upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 	13.589908385356571

 to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment 	12.163265173372114

 her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts 	21.002807415734186

 it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable 	14.67518774484902

 and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect 	21.705931387395957

 but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for 	23.63761859136119

 were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain 	17.847312212488422

 but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized 	13.483605021846563

 a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful 	14.341655201582654

 and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 	14.156831267122719

 but her letters were always long expected and always very short 	15.74149141862917

 those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild 	13.18848971160462

 that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as <title> forster called her and they were going to the camp 	15.084028298006256

 and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public 	15.423414809219604

 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn 	14.437244300353504

 everything wore a happier aspect 	30.221411697215956

 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose 	13.582428333635754

 <title> bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears 	12.144075144057927

 an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton 	10.951958267992667

 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching 	18.623656491157746

 and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from <title> gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 	11.071933936393625

 <title> gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month 	9.757885316522907

 and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour 	12.907521533260114

 and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire 	17.98389528824861

 in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks 	16.35470738728365

 and to <title> gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction 	25.13820906524976

 the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak 	12.058347863806992

 elizabeth was excessively disappointed 	44.027851579775586

 she had set her heart on seeing the lakes 	19.148891732720305

 and still thought there might have been time enough 	22.88797573012177

 but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy 	19.32031111935092

 and all was soon right again 	37.77520443549871

 with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected 	21.090268712337274

 it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner 	17.517175846515286

 the period of expectation was now doubled 	25.067765074398576

 but they did pass away and <title> and <title> gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn 	14.851176222024232

 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement 	11.123919576471394

 one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions 	14.944139699302605

 a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad 	7.108240844111062

 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay 	13.092503665925147

 oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham & <initial> are sufficiently known 	8.810337527676964

 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern 	27.81004393549495

 to the little town of lambton the scene of <title> gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country 	9.709876533236724

 and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated 	15.419408636219694

 it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it 	15.451180934625082

 in talking over their route the evening before <title> gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again 	14.707667240739381

 <title> gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 	17.986792145478283

 my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much 	24.41172432425556

 said her aunt 	69.38520300571275

 a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 	20.329654574119893

 wickham passed all his youth there you know 	17.068723941978842

 elizabeth was distressed 	107.66608804104966

 she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 	14.236437162805846

 after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains 	11.235233960778125

 <title> gardiner abused her stupidity 	22.80514550794475

 if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself 	13.57000179168232

 they have some of the finest woods in the country 	26.067055327427763

 elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce 	34.84470548213789

 the possibility of meeting <title> darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred 	15.868406225180193

 and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk 	21.684233645510982

 but against this there were objections 	34.548728745747106

 and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered 	15.632057695567863

 accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer 	13.374627992026275

 a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself 	12.8418101371618

 and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme 	15.466290140206976

 chapter <initial> elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation 	17.813514884385576

 and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter 	16.40149213416097

 the park was very large and contained great variety of ground 	15.412674584581548

 they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent 	10.189664159534523

 they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound 	10.875284862974448

 it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills 	6.363523456250339

 and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance 	8.648673155060589

 its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned 	9.78235989628707

 elizabeth was delighted 	105.8312078850849

 she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste 	11.27091962922135

 they were all of them warm in their admiration 	26.54393896363032

 and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door 	11.858507975828614

 and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned 	12.571018411373718

 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken 	19.596453322457865

 on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall 	23.055820951513947

 and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 	18.51336846115425

 a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her 	10.972709152058242

 they followed her into the dining parlour 	27.0749268425739

 it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up 	9.744669505874601

 elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect 	13.699626843006374

 the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object 	11.927922905430357

 every disposition of the ground was good 	37.52906353698431

 and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight 	13.689247980634626

 as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions 	8.751034214048907

 but from every window there were beauties to be seen 	20.358098911479768

 the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor 	15.663583886708023

 but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine 	16.93556913366271

 with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings 	12.070627278392294

 and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt 	12.758573164769942

 but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them 	17.871588660136045

 this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret 	13.408363455913221

 she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it 	13.339241257004298

 at length however the question was asked by her uncle 	16.292440403419057

 and she turned away with alarm while <title> reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends 	14.51775238071206

 how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture 	16.952509048156386

 she approached and saw the likeness of <title> wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece 	10.574134000422067

 her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it 	16.211446619437865

 the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence 	15.541733300792064

 and that said <title> reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him 	17.798712676268877

 it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago 	18.189826831200843

 i have heard much of your master s fine person said <title> gardiner looking at the picture 	19.16513408144625

 it is a handsome face 	31.32169143838956

 but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not 	22.687689005487314

 <title> reynolds s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 	14.671754193832738

 elizabeth coloured and said a little 	33.395669261717046

 and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am 	21.125369178345334

 yes very handsome 	116.61571752307522

 i am sure i know none so handsome 	16.993129623414255

 this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then 	15.592364318522328

 he was very fond of them 	33.029296291364254

 this accounted to elizabeth for <title> wickham s being among them 	24.39870305909034

 <title> reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old 	15.767656762046158

 and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother 	27.554916872899707

 said <title> gardiner 	61.16404112391141

 oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen 	16.574939028207147

 and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long 	9.625953574025903

 in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master 	18.13525988798677

 she comes here to morrow with him 	21.173817929371438

 <title> gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks 	9.949073536782258

 <title> reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 	13.826189678774837

 is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year 	23.505000662663846

 not so much as i could wish sir 	30.4902760382962

 but i dare say he may spend half his time here 	15.514557298361671

 and miss darcy is always down for the summer months 	31.538663831823595

 if your master would marry you might see more of him 	18.486364523510495

 but i do not know when that will be 	21.628819180110273

 i do not know who is good enough for him 	16.73285949565234

 <title> and <title> gardiner smiled 	39.6222235663873

 elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so 	19.278623595188485

 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far 	34.928685300669635

 and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old 	16.123621360863375

 this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas 	19.464133716338544

 that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion 	18.084450006049423

 her keenest attention was awakened 	25.500430505875286

 she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said 	17.539893795282964

 you are lucky in having such a master 	23.71806010448706

 yes sir i know i am 	42.799585189475785

 if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better 	31.003278807015977

 but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up 	13.587463831566803

 elizabeth almost stared at her 	28.58132575535321

 can this be <title> darcy thought she 	26.180949396456718

 his father was an excellent man said <title> gardiner 	20.95318679304284

 yes ma am that he was indeed 	41.14972640821525

 and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor 	22.51997854598391

 elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more 	18.563430187473074

 she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain 	20.79402112401606

 and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase 	13.736089745760289

 he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived 	22.70315603865915

 there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name 	20.856558674445587

 but i am sure i never saw any thing of it 	16.011092956166944

 this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 	18.04006303064388

 perhaps we might be deceived 	62.139947096243354

 that is not very likely 	42.55326774651251

 our authority was too good 	36.000554633578744

 on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below 	8.828495619822641

 and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley 	15.344871020978037

 he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows 	24.456614842892385

 <title> reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room 	18.328535945158496

 and this is always the way with him she added 	30.086268404597828

 whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment 	18.450732808967512

 there is nothing he would not do for her 	26.66259939285751

 the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn 	16.864978173900994

 in the former were many good paintings 	25.917986338901553

 but elizabeth knew nothing of the art 	43.01814927601722

 and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible 	10.544174528763609

 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 	18.176348941358334

 at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of <title> darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her 	14.32173044985914

 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 	14.003782105240619

 <title> reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time 	20.08078538151825

 there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance 	15.786047736917235

 the commendation bestowed on him by <title> reynolds was of no trifling nature 	17.4778608883601

 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant 	18.855662862714478

 as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before 	13.749150053332556

 she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression 	10.129342129615555

 as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again 	13.992351106550895

 her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables 	13.796916534228778

 they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight 	12.299404077210706

 their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush 	15.848203070830309

 he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise 	13.877938835695753

 but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility 	15.782139805911134

 she had instinctively turned away 	25.553352958296138

 but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome 	19.96548309969141

 had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw <title> darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it 	10.499019569331182

 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family 	11.636855549368013

 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment 	15.064176556080183

 and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 	16.17088868246651

 nor did he seem much more at ease 	25.193943355924066

 when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness 	17.452884590470152

 at length every idea seemed to fail him 	19.17516309169147

 and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave 	11.606059563001883

 the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure 	23.18897261430951

 but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence 	15.880751000113676

 her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come 	13.148310519745298

 or why did he thus come a day before he was expected 	20.32729582986029

 had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage 	12.565789743596426

 she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting 	22.657831207279354

 and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean 	14.945880483021659

 what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to account for it 	10.965705154608065

 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching 	12.847651515109476

 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where <title> darcy then was 	15.369848833715515

 in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him 	17.026004838354815

 perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease 	21.927203680205135

 yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease 	33.736352118449204

 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure 	20.4583778978341

 at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 	14.254377741708659

 whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream 	10.506824394406626

 <title> gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk 	14.014830345347807

 with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round 	19.43914548028006

 it settled the matter 	45.55539836421148

 and they pursued the accustomed circuit 	16.414251137058823

 which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts 	13.751106402810318

 they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene 	18.106092744095466

 it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited 	15.475863532857604

 and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it 	7.630713448108012

 elizabeth longed to explore its windings 	20.122784655812037

 but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house <title> gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible 	12.336940099851924

 her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction 	16.907129990908757

 whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of <title> darcy approaching them and at no great distance 	18.230858954648884

 elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them 	12.826827655309826

 for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path 	14.43493111113363

 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view 	15.904099723340588

 the turning past he was immediately before them 	23.573957025746104

 with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility 	22.679807575129633

 and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place 	14.266774017384755

 but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed 	11.084565480502652

 her colour changed and she said no more 	21.076174772265876

 <title> gardiner was standing a little behind 	25.931729049251143

 this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared 	23.572307599593024

 and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself 	11.881328345080773

 what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion 	13.984267151403728

 the introduction however was immediately made 	27.253927890467676

 and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it 	13.24402585023619

 that he was surprised by the connexion was evident 	23.250659891597195

 he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with <title> gardiner 	13.259216898403551

 elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph 	22.824239285598075

 it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 	15.721406567260862

 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners 	12.262882159289004

 the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard <title> darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 	11.554341765935666

 elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly 	30.8403445506751

 the compliment must be all for herself 	32.754427848508826

 her astonishment however was extreme 	32.204783280895356

 and continually was she repeating why is he so altered 	15.88377194817078

 from what can it proceed 	43.71619108305355

 it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened 	20.119273065161398

 my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this 	19.863022826734387

 it is impossible that he should still love me 	20.52331903993575

 after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration 	11.171744051977512

 it originated in <title> gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband <initial> <title> darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together 	13.698074198250183

 after a short silence the lady first spoke 	18.151652357840273

 she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow 	15.704231966384654

 and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country 	13.38513907138679

 he acknowledged the truth of it all 	32.62090063294027

 they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you <title> bingley and his sisters 	11.156651216871571

 elizabeth answered only by a slight bow 	27.10892992710867

 her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when <title> bingley s name had been last mentioned between them 	16.04795023630363

 and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged 	19.114779489942556

 there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton 	14.363831741460636

 the surprise of such an application was great indeed 	24.412887642925252

 it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it 	15.90106321173858

 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory 	19.694553317469158

 it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her 	16.450052288011733

 they now walked on in silence 	33.14016378773823

 each of them deep in thought 	23.758096550926332

 elizabeth was not comfortable 	86.19335163082765

 that was impossible 	90.73945028228783

 but she was flattered and pleased 	30.421879337228148

 his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind 	28.583888983826338

 they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage <title> and <title> gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind 	17.20641031780778

 he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn 	18.914130410601967

 at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward 	21.74029998277713

 she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject 	15.442484149229813

 at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance 	13.145504587266132

 yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over 	12.466211261919526

 on <title> and <title> gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment 	15.231320327175162

 but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness 	17.03867554960363

 <title> darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 	14.313706525263678

 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began 	20.710705489312545

 and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected 	22.98847901791829

 he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle 	13.230583741850479

 there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming 	20.569574728758784

 i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it 	14.174986417491475

 i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us 	17.447815716384554

 it was more than civil 	48.37211733954332

 it was really attentive 	54.81401286222014

 and there was no necessity for such attention 	26.180868533984

 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling 	44.78209988252003

 to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham 	21.086786769285883

 or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good 	18.526184956878755

 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable 	28.052274668675388

 elizabeth excused herself as well as she could 	19.794067685707926

 said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 	16.825841586591018

 but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle 	22.252932877525996

 your great men often are 	25.420068937569507

 and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds 	13.572233865584337

 elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing 	19.50830905537096

 from what we have seen of him continued <title> gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham 	17.643258528747417

 he has not an ill natured look 	27.207165996906703

 but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes 	13.191078364981454

 but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue 	19.533188623088094

 and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction 	14.379208034101053

 and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire 	13.357241109218961

 in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on 	11.771087762847156

 <title> gardiner was surprised and concerned 	24.99268189374346

 but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection 	17.33504209511289

 and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else 	14.13521182893172

 fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance 	16.108122559627258

 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends 	14.163216242258583

 and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of <title> darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 	17.06290554459211

 elizabeth had settled it that <title> darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley 	18.652444801748345

 and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 	22.005498693586524

 but her conclusion was false 	26.853278446699417

 for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came 	16.566000117323608

 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street 	15.577055390499119

 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected 	11.387322065046584

 her uncle and aunt were all amazement 	22.915004410609306

 and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business 	20.430299751681655

 nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece 	13.852658465356681

 while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing 	9.787678318108837

 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure 	34.83890046425354

 but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour 	13.934278366129645

 and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her 	10.461809294049225

 she retreated from the window fearful of being seen 	27.814785054775463

 and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse 	11.911672952624295

 with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself 	16.501393154392026

 since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud 	24.64094519457361

 but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy 	20.363026420801265

 she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable 	16.82322751220223

 miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth 	15.310963500345458

 she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle 	16.65634883503936

 elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever <title> darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings 	12.143988405699043

 they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her 	15.555658236227448

 and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room 	13.16048680468296

 all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away 	21.731273691696344

 but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again 	11.75231249677837

 he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done 	14.897496107065546

 the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention 	12.768499950602813

 the suspicions which had just arisen of <title> darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry 	12.300734406055277

 and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 	17.24315691047755

 of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt 	15.41208096707323

 but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 	16.611099578210208

 elizabeth on her side had much to do 	31.60553158316912

 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all 	16.61902053651317

 and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour 	12.863728868148732

 bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased 	17.73871091756931

 in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister 	15.114890264070128

 and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner 	16.92321328254839

 sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance 	14.553683814998664

 but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane 	17.727859805975317

 no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 	12.470577790983452

 nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister 	19.57752990702054

 and before she could reply he added it is above eight months 	19.97345517422068

 but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day 	10.555377997033244

 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace 	11.226515221357474

 when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 	10.274893664364127

 never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings 	10.824350525978941

 <title> gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head 	12.548439631369982

 presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on 	12.074954339369866

 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends 	15.096431594463182

 elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased 	18.397521559428263

 and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little 	12.321931551309145

 eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress 	13.032235158255812

 but she had no reason to fear <title> and <title> gardiner s curiosity 	17.751123876712683

 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with <title> darcy than they had before any idea of 	20.71696850288776

 it was evident that he was very much in love with her 	18.167978884375927

 they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry 	23.0303574419952

 and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find 	17.001212700496318

 they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for <title> darcy 	13.606001349780891

 and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected 	13.98469416601969

 neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight 	17.137306681154307

 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride 	21.843021562467293

 pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit 	17.51313402940286

 it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor 	16.64367372598542

 with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation 	12.984534515143745

 for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which <title> darcy afterwards discharged 	12.589121015042412

 as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last 	17.150658148928272

 and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion 	17.652939485170176

 and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out 	12.177332683436095

 she certainly did not hate him 	37.622981919947925

 hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called 	16.762886329246868

 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings 	14.082263858651395

 and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced 	9.960039657144666

 but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked 	15.307075588182292

 it was gratitude 	97.23716519433562

 gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection 	10.838865532598328

 he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister 	8.510122866872019

 such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed 	14.07817700222538

 and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined 	17.396206476645087

 she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare 	21.951606566654284

 and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses 	14.712111516071019

 it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side 	15.003434167042222

 and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning 	15.495578900556197

 elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply 	20.561113408071666

 <title> gardiner left them soon after breakfast 	24.89989637073728

 the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon 	15.041943626846887

 chapter iii 	389.700158465448

 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed 	13.119667651310065

 on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer 	9.980052164952147

 its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 	10.429217158738822

 in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with <title> hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london 	17.742213903854523

 georgiana s reception of them was very civil 	37.62368514219826

 <title> gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her 	13.784358310842649

 by <title> hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey 	19.515180652095772

 and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments 	10.373768721134237

 it was first broken by <title> annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others 	10.273061694895333

 and between her and <title> gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on 	14.857657048067592

 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it 	19.639316523038577

 and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard 	15.964652262524256

 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention 	14.34642761208118

 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance 	17.860850864538605

 but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 	21.064338115287384

 her own thoughts were employing her 	23.720483021029576

 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room 	17.935322852281338

 she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them 	23.036456381779452

 and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine 	19.598568314897467

 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family 	12.543115899202336

 she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more 	14.910936444204864

 the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season 	9.672004209366571

 but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from <title> annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post 	15.152404168286202

 there was now employment for the whole party 	29.54537638634496

 for though they could not all talk they could all eat 	19.634438370178117

 and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table 	6.759947187980244

 while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of <title> darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room 	14.226238219865222

 and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came 	15.862220593310196

 he had been some time with <title> gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning 	13.85675219077

 no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed 	15.3452670079248

 a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 	13.652993078206784

 in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects 	11.943230012294599

 for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to <title> darcy were by no means over 	18.908136639016714

 miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk 	20.35923520501723

 miss bingley saw all this likewise 	39.61945495011747

 and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton 	12.031805570703321

 they must be a great loss to your family 	35.95137232863271

 in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name 	17.667378087027913

 but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts 	21.6044427789406

 and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress 	20.21078136136851

 while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes 	9.640757242500353

 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint 	13.605701305156254

 but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps 	11.400907886288179

 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement 	17.025542696476787

 and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own 	14.97268547035694

 elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion 	12.300345952793105

 and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more 	11.135912804917808

 her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully 	14.30195673281608

 their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned 	16.718609718358806

 and while <title> darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress 	12.740764026969325

 but georgiana would not join her 	39.340103486292925

 when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 	18.25925353867335

 how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning <title> darcy she cried 	19.359284195301505

 i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 	19.52573022307797

 she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 	11.830639295424293

 however little <title> darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer 	10.951261300039102

 for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 	13.331473168789039

 her complexion has no brilliancy 	27.54378089810452

 and her features are not at all handsome 	32.723454343906425

 her nose wants character 	22.682347277662043

 there is nothing marked in its lines 	24.17889397857625

 they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all 	16.502752535036574

 and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable 	13.388834735003956

 persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself 	15.34849914459422

 but angry people are not always wise 	31.645607454666866

 and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected 	17.638636230178665

 he was resolutely silent however 	26.660499134590257

 and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty 	13.830350397114751

 and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit 	12.233101969743972

 but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time 	14.241630217845703

 yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 	18.262037877627648

 he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 	16.229445028539335

 <title> gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both 	14.330370579933762

 they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself 	15.937285900754354

 yet elizabeth was longing to know what <title> gardiner thought of him and <title> gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject 	17.718421863910343

 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton 	13.721883126465443

 and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there 	17.859058431674715

 but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere 	17.30792125603078

 elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill 	18.3650716110843

 they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in 	19.00891080326246

 and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves 	15.712615818801586

 the one missent must be first attended to 	16.882786976608795

 it had been written five days ago 	20.675335005642413

 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded 	15.3601433394593

 but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence 	9.941292481509759

 it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature 	9.640458072024696

 what i have to say relates to poor lydia 	21.134074372597834

 an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers 	13.519223500250742

 to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise 	13.783304599103106

 to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected 	15.346988631418888

 i am very very sorry 	31.244333333277236

 so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood 	15.243179134684084

 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart 	10.994764913696157

 his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing 	18.06422309652404

 our poor mother is sadly grieved 	21.833820449351045

 how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him 	16.40779640873087

 we must forget it ourselves 	28.59602114042754

 they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 	8.975063018608854

 the express was sent off directly 	20.06622367277471

 my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us 	15.221699031761155

 colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon 	15.472696576489481

 lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention 	22.46492927081776

 i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother 	22.09775645493689

 i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written 	16.56976174909574

 without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 	10.176844741012916

 by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter 	17.37465651124707

 i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent 	14.063268244557198

 dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed 	21.428338694707637

 colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express 	12.895267471477277

 though lydia s short letter to <title> <initial> gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that <initial> never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel <initial> who instantly taking the alarm set off from <initial> intending to trace their route 	9.592856211087078

 for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom 	8.797477042638997

 all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road 	18.062235676991747

 i know not what to think 	22.625311659317493

 i am sincerely grieved for him and <title> <initial> but no one can throw any blame on them 	13.783354372902592

 our distress my dear lizzy is very great 	27.686699062717906

 my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him 	14.54648816470741

 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan 	14.599336771901193

 and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing 	14.913403510901652

 he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared <initial> was not a man to be trusted 	17.994623241375944

 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 	14.350117290671475

 could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected 	17.01990444303058

 and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected 	24.279660342003595

 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment 	15.14582167980866

 but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder 	19.160497091825388

 but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return 	20.09170735597317

 i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former 	17.561265847249853

 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her 	14.751402079459439

 what he means to do i am sure i know not 	22.57976002453577

 but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening 	13.342883594367184

 in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world 	14.70873751183883

 he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness 	19.08836493891969

 oh where where is my uncle 	35.04374884558673

 but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and <title> darcy appeared 	28.145481850289997

 her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you 	9.483482709521901

 good god what is the matter 	29.90429557927239

 cried he with more feeling than politeness 	21.35966556283103

 then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after <title> and <title> gardiner 	10.687562441101372

 you are not well enough 	30.624385031433853

 you cannot go yourself 	44.553043115775345

 calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly 	8.32478273490785

 on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid 	10.041384898260828

 is there nothing you could take to give you present relief 	17.137253758316298

 a glass of wine 	23.96800709605511

 shall i get you one 	31.460803843585218

 you are very ill 	49.1948432213863

 no i thank you 	30.698670816391438

 she replied endeavouring to recover herself 	25.042211355829306

 there is nothing the matter with me 	20.77659578908889

 i am quite well 	36.96790232656684

 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn 	15.280533005758388

 she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word 	17.392171743448568

 darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence 	12.206711749619615

 at length she spoke again 	31.185915542133134

 i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news 	21.32550657487141

 it cannot be concealed from any one 	23.108669491031495

 my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped 	18.65229537425064

 has thrown herself into the power of of <title> wickham 	17.129060962009586

 they are gone off together from brighton 	22.063426279472232

 you know him too well to doubt the rest 	19.437226197908224

 darcy was fixed in astonishment 	34.76946098750254

 when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was 	16.483949319894233

 had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened 	14.649699927678665

 but it is all all too late now 	21.70508127666109

 i am grieved indeed cried darcy 	22.888168337152216

 grieved shocked 	320.1642491807636

 but is it certain absolutely certain 	30.20605042193132

 oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond 	12.630876564515363

 and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her 	16.746673413433214

 my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour 	12.639230824482997

 but nothing can be done 	48.517980598238076

 i know very well that nothing can be done 	24.697669348281398

 how are they even to be discovered 	47.018976743310525

 i have not the smallest hope 	24.254101698643787

 it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence 	9.489847586327036

 when my eyes were opened to his real character 	21.370577376222922

 oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much 	22.17072877070864

 wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer 	13.841806208222867

 he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation 	19.808376411993756

 his brow contracted his air gloomy 	15.581082457990362

 elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it 	18.141663790415816

 her power was sinking 	41.54910673813026

 every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace 	13.721710715768458

 she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress 	11.190050033975426

 it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes 	16.687268857600685

 but self though it would intrude could not engross her 	25.749937249511042

 and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else 	17.887785191408653

 and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern 	10.825454693880245

 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress 	10.793473864947325

 this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day 	13.600848494557336

 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 	19.80979094297195

 i know it cannot be long 	30.263922292673588

 he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away 	12.280822190317549

 as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire 	12.467211881357521

 and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 	9.428787281619979

 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 	11.610062067958115

 but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment 	10.423203572643269

 be that as it may she saw him go with regret 	17.6706733464296

 and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 	11.222786699416009

 never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her 	13.021592981617767

 no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation 	22.299424616288047

 surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement 	38.081455072240274

 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money 	14.901881296081374

 and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible 	13.714846378323422

 but now it was all too natural 	38.18630209183165

 for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms 	25.862219395756096

 and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 	9.938022498825212

 she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body 	14.853853522178472

 sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion 	13.779754310808892

 her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object 	13.067101642681541

 the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl 	11.117502392082388

 oh how acutely did she now feel it 	22.108951696965725

 she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged 	15.187159183417453

 a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance 	9.979324887583061

 and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe 	14.91520246345108

 <title> and <title> gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill 	11.712007565867424

 but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy 	10.864755518144737

 though lydia had never been a favourite with them <title> and <title> gardiner could not but be deeply affected 	18.238807861265954

 not lydia only but all were concerned in it 	11.78237872880124

 and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror <title> gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power 	13.989866170625083

 elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude 	16.408960741861378

 and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled 	10.130635125441358

 they were to be off as soon as possible 	25.73081635296712

 but what is to be done about pemberley 	33.74295867889499

 cried <title> gardiner 	73.57556011218712

 john told us <title> darcy was here when you sent for us 	20.539897953694116

 was it so 	34.18465649302798

 and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement 	18.378408862968914

 repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare 	27.59380503003203

 and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain 	14.327154704783059

 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself 	13.606663906959518

 an hour however saw the whole completed 	30.640775462274778

 and <title> gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go 	13.580973161486076

 chapter <initial> i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town 	20.22769321938368

 and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 	16.36937021804964

 it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 	11.798028351151292

 could he expect that her friends would not step forward 	22.840116615178935

 could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster 	15.132030669914366

 his temptation is not adequate to the risk 	31.898544871706534

 do you really think so 	29.01199557934641

 cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment 	21.73737139721681

 upon my word said <title> gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion 	20.68525461950545

 it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it 	11.359791579201417

 i cannot think so very ill of wickham 	24.616077620745706

 not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 	18.052479522131698

 but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 	23.30153135132353

 if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it 	23.302670756639706

 why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case 	19.382450144040057

 in the first place replied <title> gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland 	15.99279948950045

 oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road 	13.333785118533472

 they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose 	15.354731756313578

 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side 	12.970275555139015

 and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland 	13.178130279564508

 but why all this secrecy 	53.260425815299264

 why any fear of detection 	36.446009623479725

 why must their marriage be private 	28.67583531679931

 oh no no this is not likely 	38.38494336000844

 his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her 	14.426685867943421

 wickham will never marry a woman without some money 	22.906431489046764

 he cannot afford it 	40.81228850049414

 and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well 	9.48797747167459

 as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge 	13.18438858799713

 for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce 	23.218476103296428

 but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good 	21.89185733511716

 lydia has no brothers to step forward 	16.894880150813943

 and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter 	17.752194570907776

 but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage 	19.88250148120197

 it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 	13.626768364608584

 but really i know not what to say 	23.52908490232326

 but she is very young 	58.294514686135

 she has never been taught to think on serious subjects 	19.763812875542563

 and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 	15.488752811663705

 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 	14.861421462417733

 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it 	14.37820313973247

 susceptibility to her feelings 	119.40813033231153

 which are naturally lively enough 	20.481438438336692

 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 	12.324275739246772

 but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt 	24.125641348122837

 of whom does jane ever think ill 	13.275649255843822

 and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them 	15.604940387454397

 but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is 	18.87879342183789

 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word 	24.137100521698372

 that he has neither integrity nor honour 	20.240873345773455

 and do you really know all this 	23.786992990055328

 cried <title> gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 	23.791137310658055

 i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring 	30.714505974053814

 and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 	12.160768147104397

 and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate 	16.44504936033085

 but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless 	20.10025982437374

 from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl 	16.513017075412325

 yet he knew to the contrary himself 	44.543432753257626

 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her 	18.281080423839345

 but does lydia know nothing of this 	22.382071154555955

 oh yes that that is the worst of all 	24.721836661688922

 till i was in kent and saw so much both of <title> darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself 	22.81962639152818

 and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time 	15.022195633697924

 as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public 	18.14099572789221

 for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown 	16.823155147565018

 and even when it was settled that lydia should go with <title> forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 	13.34083497657919

 that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 	17.755866950954392

 that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts 	13.278529457847732

 when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other 	14.657882500718575

 not the slightest 	90.12323501612585

 i can remember no symptom of affection on either side 	13.718163123725718

 and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away 	18.61048656985496

 but so we all were 	35.959681823335906

 but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites 	10.512707467222942

 from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent 	40.92393061750808

 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness 	12.59259954037554

 they travelled as expeditiously as possible 	15.001144530772729

 and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day 	12.737479527220977

 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations 	17.839577441222314

 the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock 	17.879765287621225

 and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 	8.904530407657713

 elizabeth jumped out 	74.14606703124593

 and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her 	10.614581318197414

 elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives 	14.327805720494839

 not yet replied jane 	33.221342054817875

 but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well 	24.53713951794791

 is my father in town 	39.410980805743506

 yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word 	26.63425592366264

 and have you heard from him often 	30.388098668422035

 we have heard only once 	44.833662128606136

 and my mother how is she 	28.283263271571442

 my mother is tolerably well i trust 	24.780030274495704

 though her spirits are greatly shaken 	27.083835008958463

 she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all 	19.506140713749282

 she does not yet leave her dressing room 	24.617866591266825

 mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well 	18.865260801322602

 but you how are you 	42.88781988226232

 cried elizabeth 	129.98188238015902

 you look pale 	107.54105521374534

 how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well 	21.860007540160392

 jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears 	11.232655488735647

 when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give 	16.49168057618047

 she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage 	10.691090169682232

 <title> bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected 	11.127911516684604

 with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage 	9.65780464301403

 blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 	15.597191894642584

 if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened 	15.74590041453814

 but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her 	18.168694152019356

 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight 	18.57451084359337

 i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after 	16.071790460874443

 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her 	17.693963810840195

 but i was over ruled as i always am 	29.679081504565563

 poor dear child and now here s <title> bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all 	14.027279178977588

 and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do 	18.41864609056216

 they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas 	16.789888715547878

 and <title> gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist <title> bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia 	15.994556539572866

 do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain 	17.43617271897795

 as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done 	16.67142026601803

 oh my dear brother replied <title> bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for 	19.469022513706456

 and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be 	13.278733851638751

 and if they are not married already make them marry 	21.99631668181057

 and above all things keep <title> bennet from fighting 	21.800024872503062

 and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day 	8.944215381740296

 and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses 	16.75889166448824

 oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all 	17.711333339943064

 but <title> gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears 	20.331789915559906

 and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters 	17.77154786724409

 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 	12.427074516132782

 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before 	13.338538743609092

 one came from her books and the other from her toilette 	32.076719723883514

 the faces of both however were tolerably calm 	15.077872626577177

 as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair 	14.98082271943649

 and will probably be much talked of 	20.72008707706879

 but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation 	7.189599462170816

 then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson 	11.143918210010105

 that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex 	12.747236565657614

 elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply 	13.153004549369962

 mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them 	14.401383113049684

 in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves 	13.75040743329642

 and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy 	15.761057327781323

 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible 	15.16121763916876

 the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard 	16.523659785130445

 what did colonel forster say 	39.02408864804499

 had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place 	16.457517168923417

 colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm 	13.748514310850407

 i am so grieved for him 	18.677141658993584

 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost 	24.16406162261064

 he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey 	12.422809171741886

 had colonel forster seen denny himself 	18.511730599987864

 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before 	15.757850108303304

 how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 	15.571849556387107

 my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be 	11.868736275227295

 kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step 	16.840156934520973

 she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks 	19.06664641216734

 but not before they went to brighton 	36.86358552447555

 no i believe not 	67.26197742451467

 and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself 	22.037628648427617

 does he know his real character 	17.412074178798775

 i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did 	22.64979137080599

 and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt 	13.629615995946684

 but i hope this may be false 	31.80900797888558

 oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better 	14.478278042830803

 replied her sister 	54.918360542087875

 but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable 	12.480043416976164

 we acted with the best intentions 	54.19148374515533

 he brought it with him for us to see 	29.346698517979053

 jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth 	20.151975902867484

 these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed 	17.05372260483776

 i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel 	13.822069959507461

 i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off 	21.555141326804623

 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham 	15.199726514630933

 what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing 	18.17588999784053

 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure 	17.7323441806529

 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn 	20.754090677701694

 but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up 	11.620613613356673

 your affectionate friend lydia bennet 	25.061284625051055

 oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it 	19.19391021691696

 what a letter is this to be written at such a moment 	26.963479805571033

 but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey 	27.88317964150019

 my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw any one so shocked 	21.745279691774574

 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 	16.74398864759521

 my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day 	14.683646329497142

 i do not know 	23.39788103838553

 i hope there was 	39.24080200077758

 my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties 	14.361242191679844

 your attendance upon her has been too much for you 	22.441980037597315

 you do not look well 	46.501309149323696

 oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone 	20.441611306932117

 mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them 	14.978952348885027

 kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on 	11.92108780162747

 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away 	18.564868549308407

 and was so good as to stay till thursday with me 	22.430882554905722

 she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind 	17.51156214254043

 she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us 	13.977506486253311

 she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth 	15.487332842202703

 perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours 	16.960020509485588

 assistance is impossible 	71.03476921715088

 condolence insufferable 	678.5812313789854

 let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied 	17.037725457677183

 she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter 	15.778255988502877

 he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them 	12.225222116659776

 it had come with a fare from london 	23.77769501270255

 and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham 	12.818285018563902

 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach 	10.855823616050916

 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this 	15.326767131705699

 chapter vi 	389.700158465448

 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from <title> bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him 	14.190063658088995

 they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain 	15.959706139471663

 <title> gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off 	16.980112352644547

 when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on <title> bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel 	14.854614216548942

 <title> gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces 	16.003576379322574

 she shared in their attendance on <title> bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom 	22.51777477554731

 their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them 	8.588604257525628

 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light 	9.095088991114894

 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family 	12.313323856641643

 every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world 	17.768247245903368

 and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness 	19.475604290623473

 elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain 	16.1494213652105

 and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them 	10.99428281305285

 <title> gardiner left longbourn on sunday 	22.152175974475217

 on tuesday his wife received a letter from him 	17.125545247578533

 it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 	16.612966807260687

 that <title> bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information 	10.88755228619321

 and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as <title> bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings 	16.31908617117032

 <title> gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it 	14.118985897876897

 he added that <title> bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon 	14.612002447318948

 there was also a postscript to this effect 	17.343806288919364

 i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself 	12.81428116063494

 at present we have nothing to guide us 	23.772256470776608

 but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person 	10.673465507118353

 but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved 	17.076359215769067

 she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years 	15.6277311375944

 it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information 	20.69268570332333

 and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to 	14.076762842087339

 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety 	28.73796675644039

 but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected 	21.727857697970972

 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience 	18.884886376565362

 which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read 	16.744132863172766

 and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise 	11.5010633657382

 it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire 	11.038039994141617

 be assured my dear sir that <title> collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove 	10.881024411269307

 no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune 	11.500599619473052

 or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind 	12.158896573852145

 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this 	16.027209171201143

 and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and <title> bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age 	12.167610655176176

 howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by <title> collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair 	16.701354644637686

 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family 	11.346924446164824

 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 	8.960878447773231

 let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence 	10.123818714369577

 i am dear sir & <initial> & <initial> <title> gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster 	14.987071477853648

 and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 	29.99442255935538

 it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living 	13.827257418277654

 his former acquaintance had been numerous 	44.16724514881205

 there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him 	16.099180380757534

 and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount 	13.665818816540067

 <title> gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family 	18.041485167150242

 jane heard them with horror 	44.16064390927854

 a gamester she cried 	21.916071348037885

 this is wholly unexpected 	46.75343580830107

 i had not an idea of it 	33.6086658196656

 <title> gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday 	20.9978715198002

 rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit 	15.165437172069193

 when <title> bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 	18.10332331861263

 what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried 	16.799970193617987

 who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away 	22.78395305579328

 the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn 	11.60610203967152

 <title> gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world 	16.741552202224664

 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece 	18.68665537433862

 elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley 	16.03115917044455

 nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better 	13.412248031243704

 it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two 	15.635543682497053

 when <title> bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure 	23.61390625747319

 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying 	24.115345913000546

 made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it 	17.360660519449898

 it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject 	12.812661310576146

 and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that 	14.048761682938036

 who should suffer but myself 	24.20915302263412

 it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it 	25.354216953068818

 you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth 	17.199895808656798

 you may well warn me against such an evil 	18.343577025152882

 human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 	13.684032807628993

 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 	21.592869740915656

 it will pass away soon enough 	25.35710031140396

 do you suppose them to be in london 	30.034459472743684

 she is happy then said her father drily 	30.970378790288105

 and her residence there will probably be of some duration 	25.36795296720132

 then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind 	9.994285873464323

 this is a parade cried he which does one good 	14.361156520263657

 it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same 	14.33854177491542

 i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away 	10.722179125118599

 i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully 	13.805137413415986

 if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia 	18.184620767975705

 you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it 	12.59486037267495

 no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village 	10.69808289025578

 balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters 	17.37420603146724

 and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner 	16.065117399858305

 kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry 	17.497884532771845

 well well said he do not make yourself unhappy 	28.63477734888545

 if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them 	18.844281049992723

 two days after <title> bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her 	14.002441041944826

 but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask 	12.900453571158534

 what do you mean hill 	37.258697962510944

 we have heard nothing from town 	30.16929454175146

 dear madam cried <title> hill in great astonishment do not you know there is an express come for master from <title> gardiner 	13.997967040815018

 he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter 	12.35756566577564

 away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech 	16.164082806742083

 they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room 	19.632855396672742

 from thence to the library 	33.675543989069695

 and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse 	14.141783900707726

 upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock 	10.784290018960881

 jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news 	11.086336613425882

 what news 	306.62785770323234

 have you heard from my uncle 	22.487596079032834

 yes i have had a letter from him by express 	36.64459084251503

 well and what news does it bring 	34.858879501526985

 good or bad 	77.55964862041823

 what is there of good to be expected 	32.96568320244413

 said he taking the letter from his pocket 	30.032559102893934

 but perhaps you would like to read it 	31.87233175022142

 elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 	28.041002740009375

 read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about 	15.562078593650815

 gracechurch street monday august <number>  	22.780156105996515

 soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were 	14.605330697199161

 the particulars i reserve till we meet 	14.63743431853332

 it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane 	20.26493581330782

 they are married elizabeth read on 	22.88501418577243

 i have seen them both 	31.990399829937438

 they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so 	16.85798950622831

 but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are 	16.128348302989156

 all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister 	11.394439869948641

 and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum 	9.230154933325084

 these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you 	12.584981662487497

 i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer 	11.347647825812176

 you will easily comprehend from these particulars that <title> wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be 	13.817553463447785

 and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune 	12.983074091403047

 if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement 	10.968021077597983

 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again 	27.943180795795065

 send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly 	13.760041321596086

 we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve 	18.98232603910095

 she comes to us to day 	35.40591705630075

 i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on 	16.9006212971463

 is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished 	29.715790410373767

 can it be possible that he will marry her 	24.284627151047975

 wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him 	21.690700082885236

 and have you answered the letter 	25.342647055844314

 said elizabeth 	96.04818103533407

 but it must be done soon 	42.056666383294534

 most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 	17.775124245795112

 oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately 	19.39804029652468

 consider how important every moment is in such a case 	20.726315093611056

 let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself 	24.982611189274607

 i dislike it very much he replied 	24.834350451616316

 but it must be done 	39.41984420846782

 and may i ask 	48.6044928503885

 complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little 	28.217195038175436

 and they must marry yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry 	19.824502423051012

 but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about 	15.746923276257805

 and the other how i am ever to pay him 	24.13911665619767

 i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone 	11.90810025506732

 that is very true said elizabeth 	22.276808112554527

 though it had not occurred to me before 	41.50453797101599

 his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself 	12.271399410658438

 a small sum could not do all this 	21.73293820092589

 no said her father wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds 	14.783676171746523

 i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship 	18.329191369539068

 <title> bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house 	9.940439379376405

 their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room 	18.039544970416745

 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced 	12.585256317427973

 he has children of his own and may have more 	25.94572549473036

 how could he spare half ten thousand pounds 	14.69060430380251

 the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 	20.921597750701345

 their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge 	9.788537517363888

 by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy 	13.275149443091466

 his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking 	19.132427520669925

 their mutual affection will steady them 	15.923462835955988

 and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten 	10.86447568597721

 their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget 	13.27190123018872

 it is useless to talk of it 	20.7363966427783

 they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 	17.372315016876453

 he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please 	14.880141496024802

 may we take my uncle s letter to read to her 	16.160778161105995

 take whatever you like and get away 	15.762463239849431

 elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together 	20.998172540362695

 mary and kitty were both with <title> bennet one communication would therefore do for all 	15.561441117590954

 <title> bennet could hardly contain herself 	23.345131065465406

 as soon as jane had read <title> gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance 	12.026533852310227

 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation 	11.688147291719954

 to know that her daughter would be married was enough 	28.193189456577457

 she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct 	16.548472056139516

 how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly 	17.100436402741895

 lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her 	21.749127897443948

 stay stay i will go myself 	33.876406602837704

 ring the bell kitty for hill 	23.151972812805028

 i will put on my things in a moment 	23.338325561248638

 for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness 	17.641830539478505

 we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist <title> wickham with money 	19.800597011354736

 well cried her mother it is all very right 	28.960874789114808

 who should do it but her own uncle 	41.37726558922311

 if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents 	19.86286016725134

 well i am so happy 	47.352160489966195

 in a short time i shall have a daughter married 	25.78692140438176

 <title> wickham how well it sounds 	28.76182184939815

 and she was only sixteen last june 	21.379816635602968

 my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can not write 	18.626379002327766

 so i will dictate and you write for me 	24.241566380109724

 we will settle with your father about the money afterwards 	25.19770321505998

 but the things should be ordered immediately 	27.2354560522452

 one day s delay she observed would be of small importance 	19.538135413689982

 and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual 	21.3916948650685

 other schemes too came into her head 	16.0988999966675

 i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips 	17.611063734110513

 and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and <title> long 	23.49379964126606

 kitty run down and order the carriage 	18.745071250231852

 an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure 	11.13723422336045

 girls can i do any thing for you in meryton 	31.780238753944715

 oh here comes hill 	49.14042520681723

 my dear hill have you heard the good news 	20.0810276995053

 miss lydia is going to be married 	33.07273766022122

 and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding 	14.715181082518635

 <title> hill began instantly to express her joy 	19.777882668059824

 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom 	15.731014254038557

 poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough 	17.116167720710425

 but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful 	34.336263401358956

 she felt it so 	49.10883284451342

 and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister 	9.15143299765172

 in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained 	16.601564730475495

 chapter viii 	389.700158465448

 <title> bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him 	12.27907288612533

 he now wished it more than ever 	27.87106377237386

 had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 	11.210046184110702

 the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place 	10.44629584148978

 he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 	13.663537113375888

 when first <title> bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless 	18.540328915227708

 for of course they were to have a son 	34.33209906625005

 this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for 	11.165578644390669

 five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come 	18.164550549624295

 this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving 	20.28340931572717

 <title> bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 	9.927857155897836

 five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on <title> bennet and the children 	15.436469939937675

 in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him 	10.667916759865209

 he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement 	16.066202498717274

 he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them 	14.407436325400925

 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise 	13.109579811004528

 for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible 	19.888070509073746

 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence 	11.43542231091017

 his letter was soon dispatched 	55.691263514766284

 for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution 	13.00606948084451

 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother 	21.937212525004362

 but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her 	14.433735375047153

 the good news quickly spread through the house 	17.549270082514177

 and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood 	15.173123782550297

 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy 	20.901853689710624

 or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house 	13.695334237530302

 but there was much to be talked of in marrying her 	28.199821276446173

 and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain 	12.290186770601416

 it was a fortnight since <title> bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high 	15.377232451847714

 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph 	18.573211695397738

 the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants 	12.598546060253248

 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance 	11.698624546967721

 haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger 	12.072427639252266

 and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful 	10.694397317979192

 her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained 	17.39977105433432

 but when they had withdrawn he said to her <title> bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding 	15.206083583985441

 into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance 	15.283788491246472

 i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn 	13.627788654102021

 a long dispute followed this declaration 	18.746919610830584

 but <title> bennet was firm it soon led to another 	15.416409906567726

 and <title> bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter 	10.78128167997239

 he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion 	14.599773513097732

 <title> bennet could hardly comprehend it 	23.68563293930044

 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible 	11.240175316666514

 she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place 	11.763453664894088

 for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot 	13.414873851728627

 she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means 	15.60304571475726

 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended 	14.813021574647781

 for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them 	9.614989023485569

 had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that <title> darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned 	12.812606977789093

 the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this 	13.642933108129327

 she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence 	19.819123293881148

 she was convinced that she could have been happy with him 	21.545453793270465

 when it was no longer likely they should meet 	26.742030431722583

 but while he was mortal there must be a triumph 	27.953074502123915

 she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her 	12.454152143879762

 his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes 	17.489690653524274

 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both 	20.992189394360896

 by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance 	12.901259146995903

 but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was 	8.017433446687143

 an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family 	16.33376110555037

 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine 	19.479871590607722

 but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture 	9.552227204296269

 <title> gardiner soon wrote again to his brother 	20.72792753756686

 to <title> bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family 	11.789394545570245

 and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again 	22.032772440782228

 the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that <title> wickham had resolved on quitting the militia 	17.93665580463882

 it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on 	15.122252731659394

 and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army 	13.666633449716464

 it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom 	25.98678304390806

 he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent 	13.441646967261208

 i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of <title> wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself 	10.709288609070155

 and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information 	11.373591053777877

 he has given in all his debts 	33.00838229813612

 haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week 	20.617301140688284

 and i understand from <title> gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south 	15.28950129086538

 she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother 	21.37923849329331

 your s & <initial> <initial> gardiner 	21.82225363336834

 <title> bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as <title> gardiner could do 	15.992523362256698

 but <title> bennet was not so well pleased with it 	27.730206249617428

 lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment 	16.617053286691444

 she is so fond of <title> forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much 	17.197733220148958

 but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished 	14.147409734524054

 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north 	18.278479429479024

 when <title> bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come 	15.101554671003461

 and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn 	15.525294840921346

 chapter ix 	389.700158465448

 their sister s wedding day arrived 	29.83240431916001

 and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself 	25.635034854423953

 the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time 	19.078230814187567

 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets 	19.861220728936974

 they came 	406.1283052075722

 the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them 	22.14522718578038

 smiles decked the face of <title> bennet as the carriage drove up to the door 	17.360906761772448

 her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy 	22.24525530787979

 lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule 	34.49859320754563

 the door was thrown open and she ran into the room 	15.135127714001957

 her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture 	15.733773142708115

 gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness 	12.662804736138952

 their reception from <title> bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial 	18.49969098118323

 his countenance rather gained in austerity 	17.579398064751796

 and he scarcely opened his lips 	25.435248715772374

 the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him 	16.554970075511434

 elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked 	24.935116101216224

 lydia was lydia still 	40.88964983751201

 she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there 	12.552788421310234

 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all 	13.62861076754164

 but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man 	12.155032769641272

 she blushed and jane blushed 	44.1836123920837

 but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour 	11.299346217235701

 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough 	18.475002913955112

 and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies 	13.715415570670578

 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world 	20.446681823684727

 nothing of the past was recollected with pain 	23.316035299125353

 and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 	18.410376149754097

 only think of its being three months she cried since i went away 	15.943803123224752

 it seems but a fortnight i declare 	24.279983974899725

 and yet there have been things enough happened in the time 	21.5689568424731

 good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was 	15.846478215239946

 jane was distressed 	101.07398085010347

 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia 	24.879389763359615

 but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day 	12.045481591782702

 i was afraid they might not 	29.235888053425192

 and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing 	10.513600932863408

 elizabeth could bear it no longer 	29.216800770544864

 she got up and ran out of the room 	20.15045023372261

 and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour 	18.23840393664658

 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman 	12.158952342378754

 it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first 	12.038864854762295

 her ease and good spirits increased 	27.860091100096845

 she longed to see <title> philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called <title> wickham by each of them 	15.292756001148062

 well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband 	22.914089719374097

 is not he a charming man 	21.276068568403034

 i am sure my sisters must all envy me 	11.971056538593798

 i only hope they may have half my good luck 	18.168337429087355

 that is the place to get husbands 	31.752867025588834

 what a pity it is mamma we did not all go 	25.069887907513163

 and if i had my will we should 	22.200679675122505

 but my dear lydia i do not at all like your going such a way off 	19.56116481528396

 must it be so 	26.064275970880875

 oh lord yes 	111.37708610944613

 there is nothing in that 	38.26811075119961

 i shall like it of all things 	36.89363875089292

 you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us 	18.295809013928448

 we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all 	14.655478752415238

 i should like it beyond any thing said her mother 	19.606554707905588

 and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you 	19.41949327055655

 and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over 	14.619360753475538

 i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth 	25.583147010369863

 but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 	18.29334151210514

 their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them 	18.29636145498986

 <title> wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 	17.571334380184876

 no one but <title> bennet regretted that their stay would be so short 	22.58317574808681

 and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home 	16.813024696413027

 these parties were acceptable to all 	19.57745860176026

 to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not 	11.527807111917891

 not equal to lydia s for him 	23.201392455786287

 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his 	15.575879464535213

 and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances 	11.176101324551265

 lydia was exceedingly fond of him 	29.59302186870089

 he was her dear wickham on every occasion 	21.439665868930906

 no one was to be put in competition with him 	18.26305275764226

 he did every thing best in the world 	25.545209652511634

 one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe 	16.181182878459904

 you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it 	22.493868931218948

 no really replied elizabeth 	33.68738713203193

 i think there cannot be too little said on the subject 	19.338967758807225

 la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off 	24.149877272962737

 clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish 	26.567707892263666

 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock 	10.862950379635478

 my uncle and aunt and i were to go together 	28.546035894282884

 well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted 	15.446796504267947

 and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon 	19.238770159616884

 however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham 	16.717805477052536

 i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat 	25.755677619690207

 well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual 	15.028899617570154

 i thought it would never be over 	36.76704249587508

 if you will believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight 	15.851441563360657

 to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open 	12.875506302620872

 well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man <title> stone 	14.495127321925468

 well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away 	25.48274223508248

 and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day 	19.51125197297859

 but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out 	17.944387538759372

 however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for <title> darcy might have done as well 	14.230193317117262

 <title> darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement 	19.45113402300593

 oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know 	29.329821777987288

 i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say 	14.625324586642874

 it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject 	16.28830371096638

 you may depend upon my seeking no further 	15.534876848281582

 oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity 	22.77874344974824

 we will ask you no questions 	25.645578945117855

 on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away 	17.683763710400292

 but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible 	17.945304741307176

 or at least it was impossible not to try for information 	20.900175071924252

 <title> darcy had been at her sister s wedding 	28.347791932012946

 it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go 	10.149954191349822

 conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain 	20.774106829640218

 but she was satisfied with none 	38.18762479416807

 those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable 	11.491769908649394

 she could not bear such suspense 	25.71915160678929

 and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended 	11.617679297563512

 pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary 	12.557046494607432

 and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance 	28.77164588480711

 not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter 	22.778305151989517

 and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out 	11.753625420746273

 jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall 	18.497010205353575

 elizabeth was glad of it 	31.917437505869895

 till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante 	13.253690190284694

 she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy 	15.61483879521865

 for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial 	25.170756592677318

 gracechurch street sept 	103.42289447979573

 my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you 	12.133680480290307

 i must confess myself surprised by your application 	21.05299997962764

 i did not expect it from you  	28.01745666974891

 do not think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side 	15.0264759919265

 if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence 	14.92062501740332

 your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done 	19.59688549644259

 but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit 	19.12313724750919

 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor 	18.884725361787478

 <title> darcy called and was shut up with him several hours 	22.585537290021293

 it was all over before i arrived 	24.770307038508555

 so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been 	12.737925806169498

 from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them 	13.77651400472253

 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world 	13.161953556446282

 his character was to speak for itself 	38.66438611729848

 he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself 	10.67547322140464

 if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him 	19.162188311416127

 he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them 	21.214365055647715

 but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had 	16.732762403939937

 and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us 	18.930369650325975

 there is a lady it seems a <title> younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what 	13.945761401758908

 she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 	11.118122409755719

 this <title> younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham 	14.065094812283201

 and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town 	24.44617806992535

 but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted 	22.572742840453948

 she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found 	11.951301768452673

 wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her 	15.910369150200818

 at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction 	10.154243473003602

 they were in street 	57.6015228524869

 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 	12.873480651095472

 she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham 	17.42124477464708

 since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design 	12.129996487321387

 he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing 	15.172362515774259

 and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone 	16.831007365467713

 he meant to resign his commission immediately 	15.98364880012225

 and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it 	17.458786719674254

 he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on 	20.397559310704622

 <title> darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once 	22.178141395017672

 but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country 	11.865991688649913

 under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief 	15.869591567975956

 they met several times for there was much to be discussed 	28.6433987297094

 wickham of course wanted more than he could get 	25.615271921250528

 but at length was reduced to be reasonable 	30.950755770386774

 but <title> gardiner could not be seen and <title> darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning 	15.17178629580081

 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former 	14.994741834442943

 he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 	17.245244626984324

 on saturday he came again 	33.56632921767967

 they met again on sunday and then i saw him too 	21.99236001110145

 but our visitor was very obstinate 	38.212061667111755

 i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all 	16.92250001485259

 he has been accused of many faults at different times 	11.76377458549304

 but this is the true one 	45.2276994473808

 nothing was to be done that he did not do himself 	34.43359460553487

 though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole 	13.413900409763107

 they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 	14.670392150726382

 and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due 	11.095120306185713

 but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most 	13.687188782539158

 you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people 	22.827618726355915

 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above 	19.7344253805715

 perhaps there was some truth in this  	36.73175767102574

 though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event 	12.135493164745688

 but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair 	13.99510604562066

 when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley 	19.10439899809886

 but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish 	16.382278301129748

 i believe i have now told you every thing 	23.5165349732406

 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise 	18.93707272457835

 lydia came to us 	67.76399471726428

 and wickham had constant admission to the house 	21.415033505338013

 he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire 	24.95826325455232

 but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain 	15.927824900751682

 i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 	20.480238883089893

 if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen 	21.578728313750943

 i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her 	12.95269590585745

 <title> darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding 	15.207898282452005

 he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday 	18.578852289910845

 will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him 	16.548665853355494

 his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire 	14.999257988368043

 his understanding and opinions all please me 	13.782318210894159

 he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him 	15.928014221749658

 i thought him very sly 	44.02330703447961

 he hardly ever mentioned your name 	24.7309522830377

 pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from <initial> i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park 	13.959598971062938

 a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing 	15.261909704465827

 but i must write no more 	27.66533213402085

 your s very sincerely <initial> gardiner 	19.040741977261145

 the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share 	12.167284691830028

 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what <title> darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research 	11.286704420247037

 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem 	20.223019227704278

 her heart did whisper that he had done it for her 	17.480251359368054

 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham 	10.7951263161242

 brother in law of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection 	14.728810720533934

 he had to be sure done much 	30.737376187809577

 but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief 	12.623707604556314

 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong 	26.040265109808534

 he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it 	21.02272099769981

 they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him 	16.974342921013562

 oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him 	10.67453696940661

 for herself she was humbled 	73.86626544796296

 but she was proud of him 	33.12600503898622

 she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again 	20.694473521248664

 but it pleased her 	56.31220253432174

 she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between <title> darcy and herself 	11.023012923440675

 she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach 	20.272130111513093

 and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham 	16.007842422455482

 i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister 	9.78196188253884

 said he as he joined her 	38.54097625318064

 you certainly do she replied with a smile 	23.71837327622504

 but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome 	27.50416385347125

 i should be sorry indeed if it were 	18.906910933479185

 we were always good friends 	41.5621592814934

 are the others coming out 	42.02572547940617

 i do not know 	23.39788103838553

 and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley 	16.81890971436352

 she replied in the affirmative 	73.4778487061224

 i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle 	19.022513582718563

 and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose 	20.51976783826692

 poor reynolds she was always very fond of me 	25.521563371420076

 but of course she did not mention my name to you 	21.728614372016803

 and what did she say 	54.77945278781939

 at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented 	20.572076196838758

 certainly he replied biting his lips 	21.788782339356867

 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him 	40.207525630247105

 but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month 	23.233442505220292

 we passed each other several times 	29.36946530241568

 i wonder what he can be doing there 	35.425964677905185

 did you see him while you were at lambton 	26.88300812764887

 i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had 	22.19632276311507

 he introduced us to his sister 	33.39037489678068

 and do you like her 	45.56079525585218

 very much 	129.62176958559147

 i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two 	13.771357654919877

 when i last saw her she was not very promising 	29.30578042927614

 i am very glad you liked her 	17.416692709500083

 i hope she will turn out well 	22.960075417088515

 i dare say she will 	26.072388181184877

 she has got over the most trying age 	26.952152812559522

 did you go by the village of kympton 	25.491501131566903

 i do not recollect that we did 	22.651502429461782

 i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had 	23.663942322532144

 a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect 	12.471948315785886

 how should you have liked making sermons 	33.64060742684532

 exceedingly well 	228.96481633026465

 i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing 	22.611290639402927

 one ought not to repine 	45.89497715883865

 but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be 	15.005981420713562

 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent 	16.82824677982516

 i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron 	17.51650395674772

 you have 	67.70598290940484

 yes there was something in that  	46.866988413105716

 i told you so from the first you may remember 	33.159372140635455

 that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly 	14.95921332812225

 you did and it was not wholly without foundation 	29.073465169009374

 you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it 	15.539948538737473

 they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him 	16.315381373829005

 and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile come <title> wickham we are brother and sister you know 	15.229502848172892

 do not let us quarrel about the past 	27.41408815008057

 in future i hope we shall be always of one mind 	22.575332281767974

 she held out her hand 	24.79595684375552

 he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house 	15.342035723741734

 chapter xi 	389.700158465448

 <title> wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it 	12.065477469819246

 and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet 	20.191975152941822

 the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and <title> bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 	13.088364713768447

 oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again 	17.92840770328599

 oh lord i do not know 	26.231035590906142

 not these two or three years perhaps 	18.352033021180194

 as often as i can 	40.927074514828135

 but you know married women have never much time for writing 	18.42768760914198

 my sisters may write to me  	26.630486630533774

 they will have nothing else to do 	29.458733066069072

 <title> wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife <initial> he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things 	11.565396186778743

 he is as fine a fellow said <title> bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw 	15.362443936712992

 he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all 	10.802902012354556

 i am prodigiously proud of him 	18.971642614367266

 i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law 	12.334728016744009

 the loss of her daughter made <title> bennet very dull for several days 	17.33746727316459

 i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends 	15.703073468404694

 one seems so forlorn without them 	14.040122785254882

 this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth 	14.168962229886516

 it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single 	17.330091535854567

 it is no such thing 	37.34042723718671

 lydia does not leave me because she is married 	33.39114481428694

 but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off 	20.374795208466775

 if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon 	25.283126174864474

 but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation 	11.469501009159849

 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks 	14.425072273854155

 <title> bennet was quite in the fidgets 	45.24089780587974

 she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns 	16.503966071665673

 well well and so <title> bingley is coming down sister for <title> philips first brought her the news 	18.571479228905993

 well so much the better 	40.50690441771201

 not that i care about it though 	27.190346637167085

 he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again 	20.358365131358035

 but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it 	24.247250173026348

 and who knows what may happen 	25.9524903232971

 but that is nothing to us 	42.13143778358526

 you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 	13.059338916813498

 and so is it quite certain he is coming 	29.406531387500273

 he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday 	14.608681747764257

 she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed 	11.851835279910292

 it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth 	18.719532926838834

 and i know i appeared distressed 	28.8499683347345

 but do not imagine it was from any silly cause 	29.274193313989812

 i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at 	23.177640626251517

 i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain 	13.978450400917062

 because we shall see the less of him 	30.717475863996192

 not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks 	15.672101750277287

 elizabeth did not know what to make of it 	26.161181565834674

 had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged 	15.786629874004724

 but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it 	16.261322781227367

 yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself 	13.353247147634642

 in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 	17.657192954449684

 they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them 	15.416845947717617

 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again 	11.521179256107384

 no no 	192.71114662926894

 but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again 	13.712370983055227

 his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield 	15.865563677198923

 tis an etiquette i despise said he 	14.399975237501442

 if he wants our society let him seek it 	14.950286802062902

 he knows where we live 	33.33623709924051

 i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again 	9.518347480270464

 well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him 	18.911525319322575

 but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined 	14.92318878735743

 we must have <title> long and the gouldings soon 	33.270197775416605

 consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility 	23.751238683388014

 it would be nothing 	55.850754958366025

 i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of 	14.009769623071394

 my mother means well 	43.43795320243538

 but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says 	18.867713553698966

 happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth 	11.616880062331559

 but it is wholly out of my power 	35.4297463762991

 and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much 	13.437604774271954

 <title> bingley arrived 	110.09070778748945

 <title> bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could 	13.894331950848018

 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent 	11.952945910174735

 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house 	12.484521188354748

 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy 	13.953951871750274

 jane resolutely kept her place at the table 	22.66415717019523

 but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw <title> darcy with him and sat down again by her sister 	18.831613295141832

 there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty 	24.124666745964657

 who can it be 	36.652828199880574

 some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose 	22.372436981375685

 i am sure i do not know 	14.392158598009278

 <title> what is his name 	42.90658137965089

 that tall proud man 	28.5791719119605

 good gracious <title> darcy and so it does i vow 	23.912821686444573

 well any friend of <title> bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure 	16.753253491615265

 but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him 	25.294325564126243

 jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 	27.078572481554314

 she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter 	13.157746358454238

 both sisters were uncomfortable enough 	29.38960450533769

 each felt for the other and of course for themselves 	29.778971846434313

 and their mother talked on of her dislike of <title> darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as <title> bingley s friend without being heard by either of them 	17.99774090650008

 but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew <title> gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 	12.798298484851795

 to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued 	19.6142732626299

 but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley 	12.675997404250678

 the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken 	11.896511734908586

 but she would not be secure 	45.71425470006239

 let me first see how he behaves said she 	15.910857730970957

 it will then be early enough for expectation 	19.440844278151538

 she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door 	12.276366347967336

 jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected 	12.520314635993708

 on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased 	17.29791050574296

 yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance 	12.504706344957897

 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command 	15.803659885640105

 she had ventured only one glance at darcy 	19.043911999556396

 he looked serious as usual 	29.67140981856735

 and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley 	17.91985827019575

 but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 	19.34512248991448

 it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture 	19.14617293162315

 bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed 	14.055943592298549

 he was received by <title> bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend 	14.349057751497417

 elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied 	11.621696967452458

 darcy after enquiring of her how <title> and <title> gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing 	13.157573144463047

 he was not seated by her 	26.474583711154807

 perhaps that was the reason of his silence 	49.839634258152685

 but it had not been so in derbyshire 	33.18127041978661

 there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself 	37.0019513756061

 but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice 	15.657281772490517

 and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground 	9.526984634055115

 more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed 	9.784570108712058

 she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so 	14.880926465427732

 could i expect it to be otherwise said she 	21.743622445104478

 yet why did he come 	39.493570378129064

 she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself 	18.166937035105782

 it is a long time <title> bingley since you went away said <title> bennet 	15.101589677062618

 he readily agreed to it 	28.624973693036626

 i began to be afraid you would never come back again 	30.364039190488384

 people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas 	15.259260107299685

 but however i hope it is not true 	44.50451801606461

 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away 	13.832872946234437

 miss lucas is married and settled 	25.99849952489142

 i suppose you have heard of it 	31.736818339331823

 indeed you must have seen it in the papers 	42.71427110842914

 it was in the times and the courier i know 	22.378125777095907

 it was only said lately george wickham esq 	17.196828127787047

 to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing 	15.547529641025523

 it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it 	16.014778928926447

 bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations 	27.064885406529783

 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 	18.541121048361703

 how <title> darcy looked therefore she could not tell 	32.96867128655632

 it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time <title> bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me 	15.743310860022564

 they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long 	13.61867192621512

 his regiment is there 	36.59536283597332

 for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars 	23.2282656946965

 thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves 	21.68391934172899

 elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at <title> darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat 	17.0365461612857

 it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before 	12.79844047930189

 and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 	17.306438382534303

 when you have killed all your own birds <title> bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on <title> bennet s manor 	14.94221829666807

 elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion 	11.8796425763192

 at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion 	12.414034188450893

 the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them 	19.07185566733332

 their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover 	10.609017011773158

 when first he came in he had spoken to her but little 	26.245949967509365

 but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention 	30.267930816428898

 as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty 	21.232930134688747

 but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent 	21.95790442065259

 when the gentlemen rose to go away <title> bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time 	14.86349908240929

 you are quite a visit in my debt <title> bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned 	15.17850814083888

 i have not forgot you see 	20.17875290470431

 and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement 	19.944091710351643

 bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business 	14.821002478162919

 <title> bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day 	14.492571186111714

 but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year 	11.925301541117122

 as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits 	12.910215038743953

 or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more 	8.528033536244358

 why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all 	21.50251573360569

 she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 	19.706561347444282

 he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town 	17.384194097736334

 and why not to me 	46.60520837272769

 if he fears me why come hither 	17.103676332816352

 teazing teazing man i will think no more about him 	24.965781342827512

 her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth 	13.700049456170904

 now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy 	15.542129054095398

 i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 	21.708203042574674

 it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance 	9.835246625940089

 yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly 	31.877910031211382

 my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now 	19.629185632200517

 i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever 	20.152929094576248

 they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday 	29.68161901996097

 and <title> bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived 	13.008353638351354

 on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn 	15.922552599101865

 and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time 	16.03820450593571

 when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister 	14.054192530079325

 her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself 	11.954226673195565

 on entering the room he seemed to hesitate 	23.521578212325153

 but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided 	19.624782285641405

 he placed himself by her 	29.274973254839175

 elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend 	14.849758523744741

 he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards <title> darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm 	12.949215564623113

 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast 	24.94125444532439

 <title> darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them 	20.900180403973252

 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage 	15.4972378821194

 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did 	13.14627407347721

 her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind 	13.626534614403328

 and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family 	15.250981822908733

 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together 	16.05832440604243

 that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance 	13.491587741314278

 anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil 	10.969114528574364

 she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend 	20.658731540452216

 if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever 	22.06677364176385

 the gentlemen came 	56.98381582979813

 and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes 	20.567165247571456

 but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair 	10.671478317235664

 and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined 	13.020171858593088

 we want none of them 	35.180662484424964

 do we 	281.908310381814

 darcy had walked away to another part of the room 	22.08983004613701

 she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee 	14.860911583470154

 and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love 	11.42003313937056

 is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman 	15.927524839905102

 there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself 	11.28375298502913

 and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still 	17.95225070448333

 have all her friends left her 	29.90414604756164

 <title> annesley is with her 	27.73097063824895

 the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks 	17.783837963552273

 but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success 	23.645894082243903

 he stood by her however for some minutes in silence 	24.886152993902428

 and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away 	21.918346434229896

 when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 	11.013424334229477

 she now lost every expectation of pleasure 	20.37011131615647

 they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 	16.054417712450057

 <title> bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper 	13.081466626883534

 but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them 	17.341450832233008

 well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day 	18.099347769641263

 i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you 	15.653184570972948

 the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 	19.402156461727714

 the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch 	8.901985966654392

 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week 	15.593926787585115

 and even <title> darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done 	17.466297078607447

 and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 	14.633253799405674

 <title> long said so too for i asked her whether you did not 	15.250595804319854

 and what do you think she said besides 	29.900731118713217

 ah <title> bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last 	33.24035042430523

 she did indeed 	93.14346001780096

 i do think <title> long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously 	14.15417365163248

 <title> bennet in short was in very great spirits 	26.56021995404752

 she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last 	22.258027216260988

 it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth 	25.10083666610573

 the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other 	14.603533104796183

 i hope we may often meet again 	23.648112847408353

 elizabeth smiled 	351.898952966775

 lizzy you must not do so 	44.221516001853274

 you must not suspect me 	31.6277998535435

 it mortifies me 	63.22564397081892

 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it 	12.522262333920409

 i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection 	14.402344152471523

 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man 	12.110258405583707

 you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment 	18.114085039852153

 how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge 	16.06354766346386

 that is a question which i hardly know how to answer 	21.545804727759105

 we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 	14.410806945095501

 forgive me 	321.877868658426

 a few days after this visit <title> bingley called again and alone 	18.49931965399789

 his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time 	17.31093025232398

 he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits 	18.899663091361678

 <title> bennet invited him to dine with them 	23.24824349349801

 but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 	13.508102464014584

 next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky 	19.246185050076505

 he should be particularly happy at any time & <initial> & <initial>  	13.711691719220417

 and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 	15.388336838491671

 can you come to morrow 	51.51425080430771

 yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow 	33.67807037069567

 and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 	22.534980518812958

 in ran <title> bennet to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down 	13.765096370012142

 he is come <title> bingley is come 	34.54035204798998

 he is indeed 	86.14024752518611

 make haste make haste 	24.419070540812655

 here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown 	20.849426461503384

 never mind miss lizzy s hair 	17.758506417172818

 we will be down as soon as we can said jane 	24.602573373853648

 but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago 	12.91912581812106

 come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear 	11.238815319819482

 but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 	19.726246059956935

 the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening 	15.683932613100275

 after tea <title> bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument 	16.77740079583709

 two obstacles of the five being thus removed <title> bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them 	11.733250079909956

 elizabeth would not observe her 	45.66232847330052

 and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma 	15.250903778412466

 what am i to do 	29.949700023460345

 nothing child nothing 	70.93085234216595

 i did not wink at you 	22.86208074978394

 she then sat still five minutes longer 	19.647390196977046

 but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room 	12.368022199929124

 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it 	13.996306772094322

 in a few minutes <title> bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you 	13.182083504799756

 elizabeth was forced to go 	30.87524827248149

 we may as well leave them by themselves you know 	18.517056838984253

 said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 	28.423408920211383

 kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room 	18.028251007874793

 elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room 	13.501540659088178

 <title> bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual 	19.877050268119795

 bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter 	15.153936587819734

 his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party 	15.641105793261149

 and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter 	14.693235707114775

 and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and <title> bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 	13.850615568897238

 after this day jane said no more of her indifference 	29.45320882277367

 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley 	16.782336470685472

 but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless <title> darcy returned within the stated time 	13.302997375010198

 bingley was punctual to his appointment 	35.41581879389245

 and he and <title> bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on 	22.787107095815877

 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence 	9.234825271579561

 and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 	16.42527318285759

 bingley of course returned with him to dinner 	35.149149606836126

 and in the evening <title> bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter 	16.937724087162657

 elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea 	18.261999005722807

 for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes 	17.222860776911066

 on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation 	11.246689890987165

 and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all 	10.28727130430203

 their situation was awkward enough 	24.297874103271113

 but her s she thought was still worse 	32.01780114621146

 not a syllable was uttered by either 	13.792780661187146

 and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room 	12.886772081073602

 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure 	16.48996998538201

 and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world 	14.348388805019956

 tis too much she added by far too much 	21.974309322923585

 i do not deserve it 	32.44415810245838

 oh why is not every body as happy 	35.643345964166215

 elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express 	9.987117324759124

 but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present 	17.16178319790401

 i must go instantly to my mother 	34.790328134908314

 she cried 	229.6391620710791

 i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude 	22.50686186386279

 or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 	26.47467514754084

 he is gone to my father already 	40.78212580733585

 oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty 	14.79207795759963

 elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 	11.853580793035006

 and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 	14.630648756625968

 where is your sister 	49.39168085144178

 said he hastily as he opened the door 	21.275501615010054

 with my mother up stairs 	35.86615568874607

 she will be down in a moment i dare say 	22.455435322916987

 he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister 	17.148762773999994

 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 	17.634179888896075

 they shook hands with great cordiality 	30.187966668823282

 and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself 	10.755768854682463

 the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever 	13.65095432820636

 kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon 	12.931328808105134

 <title> bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour 	11.340310918237224

 and when <title> bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was 	10.570937928128215

 but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you 	21.12554866258398

 you will be a very happy woman 	38.98109316326761

 jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness 	23.90702887011639

 you are a good girl 	37.18626446325162

 he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled 	21.753725160091168

 i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 	22.239726525784352

 you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on 	16.592144954642706

 so easy that every servant will cheat you 	13.458678448431359

 i hope not so 	42.998404194649844

 imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me  	12.531387785631711

 exceed their income my dear <title> bennet cried his wife what are you talking of 	18.21916905200289

 why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more 	15.739529864950645

 then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night 	9.924655210353901

 i knew how it would be 	25.21635390740474

 i always said it must be so at last 	23.992601428392113

 i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together 	13.530771283080863

 oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten 	18.509074558725583

 at that moment she cared for no other 	14.80437506223059

 her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense 	17.94160091181952

 mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield 	27.952352156942485

 and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 	14.902893833592543

 bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn 	15.788801967884556

 coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper 	12.263150176660487

 unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept 	11.782485894800196

 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister 	22.322181686317787

 for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else 	21.951717873106023

 but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 	13.359398870373866

 in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her 	17.095988037680193

 he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible 	15.043812507061938

 i suspected as much replied elizabeth 	32.61282166494388

 but how did he account for it 	23.27648018032665

 it must have been his sister s doing 	36.406670063804

 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects 	15.81772039496752

 but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again 	16.20836861794752

 that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter 	20.71244861804307

 good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard 	11.938013345967894

 would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure 	14.349031715743466

 but it is to the credit of his modesty 	42.656436741613824

 this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities 	14.327665306590923

 elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 	13.802802047498108

 i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane 	13.34189178826724

 oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you 	13.609574664355213

 till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness 	19.819469630484072

 and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another <title> collins in time 	17.776519213769802

 the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 	17.963427593649882

 <title> bennet was privileged to whisper it to <title> philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton 	16.305273819588297

 the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 	11.352997925818372

 chapter xiv 	389.700158465448

 one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage 	16.2408373109947

 and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn 	12.900565783045227

 it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 	17.886266609763613

 the horses were post 	37.21443045267919

 and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them 	12.939411863703077

 they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered 	14.753805138604775

 it was lady catherine de bourgh 	17.585065596612903

 they were of course all intending to be surprised 	24.401469135074404

 but their astonishment was beyond their expectation 	26.307350523820457

 and on the part of <title> bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt 	17.386976780662298

 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word 	14.717660011955076

 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made 	17.115483156963

 <title> bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness 	10.845959211315959

 after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet 	15.850519909332547

 that lady i suppose is your mother 	31.930639503764016

 elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 	16.75936020293253

 and that i suppose is one of your sisters 	32.87420277020031

 yes madam said <title> bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine 	25.5149540175392

 she is my youngest girl but one 	24.66568989823342

 my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family 	13.009819274841483

 you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence 	15.014383007933272

 it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say 	12.297952110203635

 the windows are full west 	22.176454431387825

 <title> bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner 	17.67790713389424

 and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <title> and <title> collins well 	13.202345658592469

 yes very well 	110.3997224944688

 i saw them the night before last 	24.49837087414167

 elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling 	20.765443784416902

 but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled 	22.83335872579273

 i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company 	18.64699148345345

 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage 	36.11262019933073

 elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs 	13.011792932034071

 as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on 	9.811441964894307

 her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 	18.685014435885858

 they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse 	16.292221540735433

 elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 	17.420304911932003

 how could i ever think her like her nephew 	20.37608738815829

 said she as she looked in her face 	42.890520438683836

 as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither 	15.37420206547387

 elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 	29.225904583771435

 indeed you are mistaken madam 	45.67943114022811

 i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here 	21.274729658141467

 but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so 	18.285297988904986

 my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it 	12.868641172392563

 a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago 	13.888237103622744

 i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew <title> darcy 	14.129148971232633

 though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood 	27.955672846400063

 though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you 	15.235158586268625

 if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 	12.95962949539125

 your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it 	18.431809506494268

 if indeed such a report is in existence 	31.192223711169788

 if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it 	27.203647871066746

 do you not know that such a report is spread abroad 	22.68643203141839

 i never heard that it was 	25.977540884664563

 and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it 	16.572317103928945

 i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 	11.442807343947003

 you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer 	18.817120194666025

 this is not to be borne 	48.52351023089425

 miss bennet i insist on being satisfied 	23.056870486728243

 has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage 	13.964596250315825

 your ladyship has declared it to be impossible 	23.71618585742128

 it ought to be so 	38.782606338238836

 but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 	13.953419695179436

 you may have drawn him in 	21.41135185279869

 if i have i shall be the last person to confess it 	27.420842689995002

 miss bennet do you know who i am 	31.2634743697781

 i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns 	14.232049670830548

 but you are not entitled to know mine  	32.8901475174978

 nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit 	20.52611250233849

 let me be rightly understood 	25.72907748023742

 this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place 	13.474765069157607

 no never 	305.72033839513824

 <title> darcy is engaged to my daughter  	31.379032779379383

 now what have you to say 	34.696616417888926

 only this 	199.08085431719337

 that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 	21.30106719121077

 lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 	16.829196504829778

 it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her <initial> while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends 	14.239278465593335

 to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh 	13.308200124495965

 are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy 	14.27071932956532

 have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin 	16.215200187577224

 yes and i had heard it before 	50.75345078372964

 you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage 	15.748584900886819

 its completion depended on others 	16.94119925662112

 and if i am that choice why may not i accept him 	14.92435943748716

 because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it 	9.345024177405389

 for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 	15.957342596385446

 you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him 	10.525082214348751

 your alliance will be a disgrace 	40.34411923446059

 your name will never even be mentioned by any of us 	22.13970805987879

 but the wife of <title> darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine 	16.361451686196396

 obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring 	20.607424759995336

 is nothing due to me on that score 	36.24711043414946

 let us sit down 	43.33262510218247

 you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose 	17.100239383112662

 nor will i be dissuaded from it 	18.299706462655692

 i have not been used to submit to any person s whi <title> i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment 	12.834819660233121

 that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable 	20.3670875513083

 i will not be interrupted 	45.001433017540755

 hear me in silence 	49.66865535198838

 my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other 	18.82921291326279

 and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families 	10.790916329011182

 their fortune on both sides is splendid 	14.911073300794621

 they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses 	15.75987397619614

 and what is to divide them 	27.912091634262172

 the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune 	12.188224501353218

 if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up 	16.12907505127935

 in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere 	13.626366385364232

 he is a gentleman 	48.96569772456253

 i am a gentleman s daughter 	23.50791234380681

 so far we are equal 	42.01677533563896

 you are a gentleman s daughter 	26.70705303794295

 but who was your mother 	47.860210626365244

 who are your uncles and aunts 	18.206175831578783

 do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 	26.466115563850785

 whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you  	19.730830827562748

 tell me once for all are you engaged to him 	23.49535511253881

 though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question 	18.234578898617904

 she could not but say after a moment s deliberation i am not 	14.656904935227681

 lady catherine seemed pleased 	39.16755836769791

 and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement 	17.948986429424288

 i will make no promise of the kind 	32.22212913825131

 miss bennet i am shocked and astonished 	27.081982570458013

 i expected to find a more reasonable young woman 	23.254642903724065

 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede 	24.420551369691935

 and i certainly never shall give it 	22.317904834529518

 i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 	14.53076155505527

 your ladyship wants <title> darcy to marry your daughter 	22.56679387144846

 but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable 	14.751472099603108

 supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin 	16.729173635479825

 allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged 	15.256674769530752

 you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these 	14.822286796670728

 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell 	17.69643931905325

 but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 	16.933655309481015

 i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject 	18.286724508826296

 not so hasty if you please 	29.966340840626337

 i have by no means done 	29.253610240292144

 to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add 	17.56162251094993

 i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement 	20.289284578456606

 i know it all 	48.29252721514999

 that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles 	17.515270138173747

 and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister 	27.29517738915848

 is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother 	21.322955557148763

 i must beg to return to the house 	24.256534959327258

 lady catherine rose also and they turned back 	23.675469852858544

 her ladyship was highly incensed 	27.11067901565923

 you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody 	16.24206826462925

 lady catherine i have nothing farther to say 	24.639688046844277

 you know my sentiments 	51.90707238502023

 you are then resolved to have him 	30.41260076054725

 i have said no such thing 	35.44779327513205

 i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me 	12.762721707238915

 it is well 	71.80686476700957

 you refuse then to oblige me 	21.674656590849867

 you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude 	10.274179869781292

 you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world 	18.9715335606816

 neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance 	14.745391630563814

 no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with <title> darcy 	14.22199720365897

 and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn 	17.81462826532474

 and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well 	14.038533931727727

 i shall now know how to act 	26.027503243681434

 do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified 	17.915688641685488

 i came to try you 	48.76260621193014

 i hoped to find you reasonable 	32.96673585107752

 but depend upon it i will carry my point 	23.115944391509125

 in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet 	13.517046722756424

 i send no compliments to your mother 	23.537469759580446

 you deserve no such attention 	37.96835051735378

 i am most seriously displeased 	24.494680169477103

 elizabeth made no answer 	29.630292405337062

 and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself 	15.148918434126127

 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs 	19.104085525057382

 she did not choose it said her daughter she would go 	27.31216413845687

 she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well 	12.691144957259134

 she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you 	14.0203982195807

 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy 	29.856653249489963

 elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here 	26.47306160988788

 for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 	15.934676981570064

 chapter xv 	389.700158465448

 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome 	11.80131785835694

 nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly 	21.148723632513516

 lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with <title> darcy 	10.108523524401587

 it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine 	15.535423139427763

 till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea 	16.61906024755647

 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 	14.596884121171462

 and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time 	9.3328180603639

 in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference 	13.28030589877156

 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew 	17.463407709609005

 and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce 	20.093334858114073

 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do 	17.17964337119183

 and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side 	11.9570485512564

 with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning 	10.648108345121221

 if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him 	10.75998219177563

 in that case he would return no more 	20.45098649085248

 lady catherine might see him in her way through town 	25.459559510648464

 and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way 	17.681409182133148

 i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy 	18.545379895926498

 the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great 	18.158734057215813

 but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased <title> bennet s curiosity 	15.576885653590157

 and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject 	14.041734562799288

 the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 	23.493359860900956

 lizzy said he i was going to look for you 	30.156366859685562

 come into my room 	42.99196842744902

 she followed him thither 	43.26630838549854

 and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 	18.028979472170203

 it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine 	23.184822474391424

 and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations 	15.676549102761411

 she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down 	23.452632735130663

 he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 	17.76745375000368

 as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents 	17.275348383874302

 i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony 	18.274403434168498

 let me congratulate you on a very important conquest 	30.424979726509292

 the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt 	14.996477778824097

 and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself 	16.05320794496305

 when her father continued you look conscious 	34.24703166106697

 young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these 	14.057399704292916

 but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer 	13.89848207394835

 from <title> collins and what can he have to say 	24.496845437375725

 something very much to the purpose of course 	34.87359305244177

 he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases 	14.987538264992166

 i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point 	13.253329131019644

 what relates to yourself is as follows 	22.955790336618342

 having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of <title> collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority 	12.887966859396807

 your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land 	12.86257952702829

 can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this 	13.755924452459851

 this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage 	8.335437646314933

 yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of 	11.45539172589345

 have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is 	12.956587371256848

 but now it comes out 	28.680214840052532

 my motive for cautioning you is as follows 	18.75953708864701

 we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye 	20.726667251936004

 <title> darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you 	21.55953051548149

 could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related 	10.281676878244665

 <title> darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile 	12.010379970107635

 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 	14.152571460577345

 are you not diverted 	52.90459509750335

 pray read on 	105.586394252562

 after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion 	15.731021122451716

 when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 	13.267909546722988

 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 	15.089163619312563

 <title> collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known 	12.50139200284991

 it was an encouragement of vice 	20.834900935249987

 and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it 	13.740560808215328

 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 	13.686139584476596

 that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch 	13.996948397253078

 but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it 	23.45694005579625

 you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 	15.547215140256743

 for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn 	16.416657863413434

 oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted 	44.64873589968654

 but it is so strange yes that is what makes it amusing 	18.110273392043467

 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing 	21.27704285701045

 but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up <title> collins s correspondence for any consideration 	12.5653691709062

 nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law 	12.465503626781592

 and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report 	15.002535582756623

 did she call to refuse her consent 	17.740778936719884

 to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh 	17.792591447289748

 and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it 	18.819333802881665

 elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 	18.30829452582253

 it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried 	20.222330141650062

 her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of <title> darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much  	12.618569665297423

 chapter xvi 	389.700158465448

 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected <title> bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit 	14.30753814530955

 the gentlemen arrived early 	36.1706421937812

 it was agreed to 	33.252846173625244

 <title> bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together 	12.630119461052898

 bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them 	13.777875652746548

 very little was said by either 	29.122924117207187

 kitty was too much afraid of him to talk 	31.380846997770707

 elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution 	14.906255027273982

 and perhaps he might be doing the same 	29.425018406402895

 they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria 	16.55607988529184

 now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said <title> darcy i am a very selfish creature 	17.235466876002203

 and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your <initial> i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister 	14.112109580521004

 ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 	16.383588815271352

 were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express 	17.494511400433428

 i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness 	13.545935716274876

 i did not think <title> gardiner was so little to be trusted 	32.089966076398966

 you must not blame my aunt 	25.07527362169824

 lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter 	21.00824739205517

 and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars 	21.26686749172359

 let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them 	12.985548159132874

 if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone 	19.53694666718118

 that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny 	16.35030637124292

 but your family owe me nothing 	25.22029017548793

 much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you  	19.30137551525688

 elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 	24.260928654280537

 after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me 	11.168067191454458

 if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once 	16.589359082266405

 my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever 	12.855788020573906

 elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak 	17.39598289380936

 and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances 	11.50403081607172

 the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before 	17.53831358879658

 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him 	8.902756171473168

 but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable 	18.34214402382676

 there was too much to be thought 	46.40047450194424

 and felt and said for attention to any other objects 	30.669559805886664

 dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give 	11.459515768021886

 but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise 	26.711458683719258

 it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before 	24.26710104793533

 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly 	14.665776471733592

 elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that  	17.723084647304

 what did you say of me that i did not deserve 	31.393792575606444

 for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof 	8.515039391368132

 it was unpardonable 	98.72546846578487

 i cannot think of it without abhorrence 	39.66622772764926

 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth 	15.545609007187004

 the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable 	14.072921698816959

 but since then we have both i hope improved in civility 	21.355070218022178

 i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself 	20.07335716226119

 the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me 	15.124369878923337

 those were your words 	42.09200932192124

 you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me 	15.53600369261003

 though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice 	23.329018212195813

 i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 	16.02428790091973

 i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way 	18.114760945947488

 i can easily believe it 	30.014670925544742

 the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me 	16.460468997134168

 oh do not repeat what i then said 	33.51752173262519

 these recollections will not do at all 	32.227413699641744

 i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it 	16.050368822929194

 did it said he did it soon make you think better of me 	21.87495658807951

 she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 	17.51425646166563

 i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary 	19.847375467271203

 i hope you have destroyed the letter 	24.268877294282802

 there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again 	14.02670958793643

 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me 	12.04990773879247

 the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard 	17.32533848583052

 but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies 	13.037795961654783

 when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 	12.998925511970889

 the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so 	17.77428549399882

 the adieu is charity itself 	16.5755482806832

 but think no more of the letter 	39.24977254918491

 the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten 	13.913905104363085

 you must learn some of my philosophy 	41.22615993373073

 think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure 	11.942187494779022

 i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind 	23.437037986487585

 your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance 	12.991231361036826

 painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled 	14.158411821962595

 i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle 	15.946850902989699

 as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper 	15.373700440170863

 i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit 	14.6459411158957

 unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 	9.92562674984895

 such i was from eight to eight and twenty 	16.66063452745821

 and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous 	10.310887835144467

 by you i was properly humbled 	32.62671622943022

 i came to you without a doubt of my reception 	34.41182364517723

 you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 	13.275116152266461

 indeed i had 	89.58612201478456

 what will you think of my vanity 	50.447457283502246

 i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses 	24.96861620055811

 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you 	13.586298625948217

 i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong 	13.233455577695496

 how you must have hated me after that evening 	19.124203259284673

 i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me 	18.369997747826073

 you blamed me for coming 	33.53390180008897

 no indeed 	184.11355954083083

 i felt nothing but surprise 	52.487789364795354

 my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 	17.401990231276315

 my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past 	16.418035770573223

 and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to 	9.705282678253475

 he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption 	18.525500359800166

 which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 	11.545311301080567

 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home 	12.867447119640191

 what could become of <title> bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 	16.238047686307713

 darcy was delighted with their engagement 	36.612976426694026

 his friend had given him the earliest information of it 	21.156597264214195

 i must ask whether you were surprised 	31.20648019642569

 said elizabeth 	96.04818103533407

 not at all 	28.286963212024187

 when i went away i felt that it would soon happen 	24.249046335793224

 i guessed as much 	39.62026623820084

 and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case 	17.94459434113966

 on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago 	16.314911078215268

 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent 	16.31360673438025

 his surprise was great 	47.18907943550679

 he had never had the slightest suspicion 	34.11440749165776

 i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him 	16.03772143329408

 elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend 	15.120140716953815

 did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring 	13.948724305110506

 from the former 	99.37678543616397

 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here 	18.01760106334352

 and i was convinced of her affection 	47.38489734691609

 and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him 	17.51304653571323

 it did 	233.18832509575597

 bingley is most unaffectedly modest 	28.640268582164794

 i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him 	16.44016838576424

 i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him 	15.85392237481138

 he was angry 	108.80098265317555

 but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments 	16.68350734838649

 he has heartily forgiven me now 	17.48908962710881

 but she checked herself 	46.040487212705244

 she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin 	15.427659099069553

 in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house 	14.975364610722607

 in the hall they parted 	30.53643555740335

 my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to 	19.668528264667632

 was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table 	16.966151269888307

 she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge 	18.85729320471349

 she coloured as she spoke 	47.735484065900096

 but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth 	15.651025583921298

 the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary 	16.539365231930798

 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent 	9.104686325998012

 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth 	18.644749117659124

 for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her 	12.185984562035417

 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known 	24.658966127010434

 she was aware that no one liked him but jane 	24.18872442036523

 and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 	18.167613315168303

 at night she opened her heart to jane 	18.874516948552397

 you are joking lizzy 	34.73886395566441

 this cannot be engaged to <title> darcy no no you shall not deceive me 	20.391251091998022

 i know it to be impossible 	41.29812112970425

 this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you 	12.854792223900125

 and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not 	13.015959863139484

 yet indeed i am in earnest 	41.70925061311343

 he still loves me and we are engaged 	25.983998896928064

 jane looked at her doubtingly 	40.95009817510857

 oh lizzy it cannot be 	28.295802615803858

 i know how much you dislike him 	27.12895164075738

 you know nothing of the matter 	38.786869029211964

 that is all to be forgot 	55.87958163588319

 perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now 	27.758807961357775

 but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable 	18.605192156162293

 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself 	20.712164346872772

 miss bennet still looked all amazement 	23.65552978702017

 elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth 	30.71796867681992

 good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane 	12.569497969124308

 my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain 	22.549745066625622

 forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him 	24.065725323381333

 there can be no doubt of that 	27.231530989939095

 it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world 	15.340841618058

 but are you pleased jane 	43.27203938912558

 shall you like to have such a brother 	39.040862998677085

 very very much 	65.24490249374716

 but we considered it we talked of it as impossible 	25.04670622977097

 and do you really love him quite well enough 	21.87113544811782

 oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection 	20.33008530731376

 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do 	20.22358595114608

 oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all 	24.343206644998286

 what do you mean 	39.38820129521616

 why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley 	28.380987902668604

 i am afraid you will be angry 	25.47752384153612

 i want to talk very seriously 	31.490857049344932

 let me know every thing that i am to know without delay 	21.4975889750135

 will you tell me how long you have loved him 	20.375780493240796

 it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began 	17.457179496710225

 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley 	13.365679288786723

 another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect 	13.815372060437232

 and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment 	15.613652694239923

 when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish 	19.277783917721262

 now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself 	22.955789979100214

 i always had a value for him 	26.900769667368202

 were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him 	21.7082765449444

 but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me 	16.240810420487332

 but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me 	16.972961971755975

 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you 	19.738479348518695

 elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 	45.811684149025595

 she had been unwilling to mention bingley 	27.652474240074202

 and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend 	15.53618998247852

 but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage 	17.720683618599786

 all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation 	15.549276561713288

 good gracious cried <title> bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable <title> darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here 	11.84349457653203

 i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company 	13.697042065522645

 what shall we do with him 	40.158032316405574

 lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way 	29.08838226314847

 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal 	13.661759990266722

 yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet 	22.1405802443742

 as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information 	11.434289095845925

 and he soon afterwards said aloud <title> bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day 	13.5392261102269

 it is a nice long walk and <title> darcy has never seen the view 	16.51942954138456

 but i am sure it will be too much for kitty 	20.825499728627992

 wont it kitty 	124.05706595527279

 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented 	16.188559056348538

 as she went up stairs to get ready <title> bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 	14.224890482656988

 but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know 	20.81396746355017

 and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then 	17.53487792015814

 so do not put yourself to inconvenience 	27.3942116874103

 during their walk it was resolved that <title> bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening 	20.025161384209067

 sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 	15.135389802574743

 but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense 	15.95224770306598

 and she could no more bear that <title> darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation 	20.406988009198052

 in the evening soon after <title> bennet withdrew to the library she saw <title> darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme 	17.73934014951197

 she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till <title> darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile 	13.384674227830352

 in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty 	14.381731549911756

 and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library 	16.357844313798456

 she was gone directly 	59.697893535168824

 her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious 	16.81960138981315

 lizzy said he what are you doing 	33.39020636117376

 are you out of your senses to be accepting this man 	24.529164011606614

 how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give 	11.973984133660236

 or in other words you are determined to have him 	20.636485723668216

 he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane 	13.239147912998172

 but will they make you happy 	25.126040568810016

 have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference 	17.65224457133241

 none at all 	60.752967581140496

 we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man 	21.571211192162227

 indeed he has no improper pride 	38.062750036514736

 he is perfectly amiable 	48.438692240721146

 you do not know what he really is 	23.77633037937553

 he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask 	17.018413403032426

 i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him 	26.391479600584802

 but let me advise you to think better of it 	24.16436038528444

 unless you looked up to him as a superior 	38.491776577299206

 your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage 	14.770864010942569

 my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 	13.045022659578239

 elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply 	15.718717500922203

 and at length by repeated assurances that <title> darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match 	9.883196284734602

 well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say 	19.95145666057739

 if this be the case he deserves you 	25.75294241417655

 i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy 	19.744037672186714

 to complete the favourable impression she then told him what <title> darcy had voluntarily done for lydia 	10.659592696514316

 this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing 	15.407279434069848

 made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better 	10.332002916708673

 it will save me a world of trouble and economy 	16.348142159768457

 had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him 	17.10444168297792

 but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way 	15.185535066893689

 i shall offer to pay him to morrow 	26.863464303326207

 he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter 	16.350868838562473

 he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading <title> collins s letter 	14.090039200947992

 and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure 	14.68178791225938

 elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight 	23.985460176585285

 and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 	15.606995466559255

 every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away 	14.652576208165051

 its effect was most extraordinary 	42.79791387393883

 for on first hearing it <title> bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable 	11.465556099396451

 nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard 	17.95793724563205

 though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 	18.80942081553435

 she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself 	10.630979393607026

 good gracious lord bless me only think dear me <title> darcy who would have thought it and is it really true 	15.454893748895993

 oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all 	10.69744247996309

 i am so pleased so happy 	18.652578348539784

 such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before 	11.40468786706037

 i hope he will overlook it 	27.350982207927203

 dear dear lizzy 	63.3793300290695

 a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me 	11.924922680019867

 i shall go distracted 	45.861468434550666

 this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away 	15.128531416739776

 but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her 	22.66569841426549

 my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence 	12.359981757719813

 you must and shall be married by a special licence 	22.77840251395709

 but my dearest love tell me what dish <title> darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow 	19.511349564547462

 this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be 	18.07071892120642

 and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for 	20.52444624202331

 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected 	20.69464303535991

 for <title> bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion 	15.097012183128765

 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him 	17.2653150546988

 i admire all my three sons in law highly said he 	13.261789739592022

 wickham perhaps is my favourite 	37.51788256672869

 but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane <initial> chapter xviii 	17.60817081503386

 elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted <title> darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 	11.424281874597808

 how could you begin 	49.08240766810069

 i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning 	17.297324561287546

 but what could set you off in the first place 	23.192181240203407

 i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation 	14.699379894025789

 it is too long ago 	35.66264537285047

 i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun 	30.130309743132038

 my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not 	14.38005818980641

 now be sincere 	95.44047421416475

 did you admire me for my impertinence 	28.452509632760908

 for the liveliness of your mind i did 	22.77606881774911

 you may as well call it impertinence at once 	17.50297539350187

 it was very little less 	41.40914916057385

 the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention 	13.488792196531952

 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone 	14.818784289461824

 i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them  	17.127889140541214

 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it 	18.55172926585467

 but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just 	11.770097047714962

 and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 	8.595271051247602

 there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it 	16.994833163335258

 and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 	15.05981178639814

 to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love 	12.057954735060028

 was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield 	15.26602810668201

 dearest jane who could have done less for her 	27.504140930548008

 but make a virtue of it by all means 	26.793190057210236

 my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible 	12.077529624046296

 and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be 	11.377029662834774

 and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 	13.370256870587392

 what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here 	13.175402527243364

 why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me 	19.752384914766314

 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement 	19.634461790935358

 but i was embarrassed 	77.41470657060125

 and so was <initial> you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 	18.84444447546907

 a man who had felt less might 	24.728846462067995

 how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself 	19.5166346847

 too much i am afraid 	43.82884096116743

 for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject 	12.48873925046624

 you need not distress yourself 	31.239663074508258

 the moral will be perfectly fair 	35.73648829162283

 lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts 	11.503216905919162

 i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 	13.446561875952746

 i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your <initial> my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing 	16.69175799813901

 lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use 	13.482407207285487

 but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for 	24.834329599490673

 was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed 	13.433650157988932

 or had you intended any more serious consequence 	20.453815506991674

 my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me 	20.462415937463696

 my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made 	16.895368993236556

 i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth 	13.68852020381949

 but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly 	18.95110876589574

 but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected 	20.27736029331429

 but to say the truth i was too cross to write 	25.86508988328296

 you supposed more than really existed 	31.910626614632783

 give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err 	9.663347306516387

 how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful 	20.20784563858482

 we will go round the park every day 	20.78705651507975

 i am the happiest creature in the world 	15.453446341580227

 perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice 	26.43740731714137

 i am happier even than jane 	20.02187087143364

 she only smiles i laugh 	29.06072453153479

 <title> darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me 	19.256741853996868

 you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 	24.36745303578558

 your s & <initial> <title> darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style 	18.199033770565507

 and still different from either was what <title> bennet sent to <title> collins in reply to his last 	18.89264460220338

 dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations 	18.42593073547105

 elizabeth will soon be the wife of <title> darcy 	20.19236898128528

 console lady catherine as well as you can 	29.331657643751182

 but if i were you i would stand by the nephew 	28.247306372024408

 he has more to give 	45.58046391512606

 your s sincerely & <initial> miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere 	16.186758161259768

 she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard 	15.583348915151138

 and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 	12.69017686617745

 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 	12.839138707898767

 before any answer could arrive from <title> collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge 	12.766571874949838

 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 	21.00997506967206

 at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw <title> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband 	13.774349618026632

 he bore it however with admirable calmness 	20.62514094260292

 he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st 	10.402220901364712

 if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight 	13.979913315019282

 <title> philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance 	12.731466309278119

 and though <title> philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar 	15.8637441519923

 nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant 	21.832879293090134

 elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification 	16.709306842066297

 and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future 	15.402582005989544

 and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley 	14.582729876722194

 chapter xix 	389.700158465448

 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <title> bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters 	18.982349702343075

 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited <title> bingley and talked of <title> darcy may be guessed 	16.171205162208157

 i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life 	15.04374238004652

 though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly 	12.86252274873221

 <title> bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly 	17.749717052180486

 his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do 	13.45606032848895

 he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected 	21.926625158696297

 <title> bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth 	20.58382444611344

 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart 	14.064810902338321

 he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other 	11.402844187259815

 in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great 	15.15661090343854

 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid 	8.454925723062571

 from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though <title> wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going 	14.74784421598589

 and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <title> bennet s being quite unable to sit alone 	14.707242543740474

 mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit 	15.215110929625462

 and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance 	17.758856118449323

 as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters 	15.22665994464146

 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her 	10.087502869856387

 and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune 	14.990851320171503

 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished 	16.847251576771736

 the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy 	20.34179519647995

 if you love <title> darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy 	22.051300494713608

 it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us 	21.238610900887384

 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 	12.157459377471802

 yours & <initial> as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind 	14.775024441760545

 such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them 	13.357462371879885

 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support 	12.876726039757022

 and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills 	9.010720436019886

 their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme 	15.804792327868888

 they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought 	12.20933393472171

 her s lasted a little longer 	25.320778043727323

 and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her 	14.70586337519404

 though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession 	15.628112240401089

 lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath 	14.010787850934335

 and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone 	13.919366842984982

 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage 	21.44684785898404

 but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment 	11.946182845330897

 was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth 	7.0253608078732155

 pemberley was now georgiana s home 	30.075122061196275

 they were able to love each other even as well as they intended 	23.708290775728134

 georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth 	22.71173146481191

 though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother 	13.459198586370919

 he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry 	10.927358423569698

 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way 	17.54629752915778

 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew 	22.476757797904753

 and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end 	11.95100763213719

 but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation 	11.807779515017106

 and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself 	15.880931474745632

 and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 	14.032691904270107

 with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate ter <title> darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them 	19.39976925006838

 and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them 	11.949049263205863
