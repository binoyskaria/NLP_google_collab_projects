 a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air 	15.44032715634898

 he held the bowl aloft and intoned — introibo ad altare dei  	9.415802909085437

 halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely —come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest 	12.416739374886891

 he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains 	12.593598727749557

 then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head 	19.087188427144227

 stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak 	12.501826593221743

 buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly 	23.68637802313818

 —back to barracks he said sternly 	55.0500192562443

 he added in a preacher’s tone —for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns 	15.839594385270217

 slow music please 	80.6584557852652

 shut your eyes gents 	64.63769138720552

 one moment 	256.6850772022433

 a little trouble about those white corpuscles 	26.877476313521395

 silence all 	342.1347508875557

 he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points 	11.158547238381058

 two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm 	22.119534756047234

 —thanks old chap he cried briskly 	34.648470061369316

 that will do nicely 	61.974910325901824

 switch off the current will you 	45.865692911960544

 he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown 	17.02882496289544

 the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages 	11.176919015425872

 a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips 	19.556961096112445

 —the mockery of it he said gaily 	38.88000279742419

 your absurd name an ancient greek he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself 	12.13711749320699

 stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck 	13.50108033077568

 buck mulligan’s gay voice went on 	26.06222788828647

 —my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls 	20.89769208103398

 but it has a hellenic ring hasn’t it 	21.747732162118314

 tripping and sunny like the buck himself 	36.05938134584731

 we must go to athens 	81.72341645130652

 will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid 	18.465885131909268

 he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried —will he come 	19.96434485455587

 the jejune jesuit ceasing he began to shave with care 	13.199691516370729

 —tell me mulligan stephen said quietly 	41.927413446785444

 —yes my love 	69.85528678408826

 —how long is haines going to stay in this tower 	27.24358077009583

 buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder 	20.400167615617598

 —god isn’t he dreadful 	35.63501276870931

 he said frankly 	165.87089424511788

 a ponderous saxon 	94.60118364067142

 he thinks you’re not a gentleman 	33.68059847882976

 god these bloody english bursting with money and indigestion 	15.409165567479988

 because he comes from oxford 	63.78126563109151

 you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner 	25.93946105442541

 he can’t make you out 	39.90269251584958

 o my name for you is the best kinch the knife blade 	44.092846989816756

 he shaved warily over his chin 	40.336254970146456

 —he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said 	24.769028742253035

 where is his guncase 	96.4430332997817

 were you in a funk 	97.73978687600336

 —i was stephen said with energy and growing fear 	25.048266713132918

 out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther 	16.80167392922776

 you saved men from drowning 	32.687073185206366

 i’m not a hero however 	27.3529608837219

 if he stays on here i am off 	33.30998852545605

 buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade 	41.80743283354242

 he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily 	14.430240404974786

 —scutter he cried thickly 	48.87597332596928

 he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket said —lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor 	14.442390801822937

 stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief 	21.197120869016867

 buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly 	21.115944180609777

 then gazing over the handkerchief he said —the bard’s noserag a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen 	21.101036516839358

 you can almost taste it can’t you 	18.695416170546725

 he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly 	14.810192363177356

 —god he said quietly 	82.5775747504638

 isn’t the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother 	19.41554485015257

 the snotgreen sea 	79.48058444929066

 the scrotumtightening sea 	68.29282421732736

 epi oinopa ponton  	100.13222945862854

 ah dedalus the greeks i must teach you 	28.3991133566313

 you must read them in the original 	49.796248784408775

 thalatta thalatta she is our great sweet mother 	27.911367806410183

 come and look 	128.44557866684156

 stephen stood up and went over to the parapet 	44.087240845782745

 leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown 	24.302477324527988

 —our mighty mother buck mulligan said 	21.960713436238997

 he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face 	19.766189371207016

 —the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said 	17.123696468221144

 that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you 	19.0468283041126

 —someone killed her stephen said gloomily 	42.742565015330165

 —you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said 	12.484537606253141

 i’m hyperborean as much as you 	18.19271567143099

 but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her 	19.963077772421904

 and you refused 	113.43604700555134

 there is something sinister in you 	25.873347980541677

 he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek 	15.06280211258619

 a tolerant smile curled his lips 	16.61396680689786

 —but a lovely mummer he murmured to himself 	22.870823549868494

 kinch the loveliest mummer of them all he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously 	18.884707780762433

 stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve 	14.839057735640287

 pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart 	23.063359569445563

 silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes 	10.465216784431057

 across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him 	16.06518284833316

 the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid 	12.130357860918961

 a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting 	10.4843710944546

 buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade 	29.812339074372762

 —ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice 	36.663933801871906

 i must give you a shirt and a few noserags 	44.35452453708353

 how are the secondhand breeks 	52.199471246824594

 —they fit well enough stephen answered 	21.129506284322016

 buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip 	17.452979935914588

 —the mockery of it he said contentedly 	39.95221555348843

 secondleg they should be 	72.38729581197066

 god knows what poxy bowsy left them off 	14.791854513305978

 i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey 	29.43993179962417

 you’ll look spiffing in them 	19.790262277208782

 i’m not joking kinch 	20.97319169176387

 you look damn well when you’re dressed 	31.14457717663462

 —thanks stephen said 	58.12202072706946

 i can’t wear them if they are grey 	28.776380865057575

 —he can’t wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror 	23.669769187013564

 etiquette is etiquette 	118.300595436763

 he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers 	26.259234524518522

 he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin 	11.641391589544073

 stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes 	24.606718786470207

 —that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have <initial> <initial> <initial> he’s up in dottyville with connolly norman 	20.675656010038722

 general paralysis of the insane he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea 	13.884851603501383

 his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth 	21.473035537880598

 laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk 	23.530598549918587

 —look at yourself he said you dreadful bard stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack 	19.7321938938043

 hair on end 	129.19317344418272

 as he and others see me 	37.91134155007135

 who chose this face for me 	24.72246872970507

 this dogsbody to rid of vermin 	23.453506903431702

 it asks me too 	46.19583725278002

 —i pinched it out of the skivvy’s room buck mulligan said 	22.82344572892152

 it does her all right 	38.95954376147531

 the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi 	11.906357840229413

 lead him not into temptation 	42.69704715270643

 and her name is ursula 	67.7202528730666

 laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes 	27.9719241939903

 —the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said 	15.835752301926528

 if wilde were only alive to see you drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness —it is a symbol of irish art 	16.450284540471678

 the cracked lookingglass of a servant 	34.50037492121428

 buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them 	17.204770150446286

 —it’s not fair to tease you like that kinch is it 	18.27877872796625

 he said kindly 	131.7821931733095

 god knows you have more spirit than any of them 	26.05332340230189

 parried again 	1034.3861815211023

 he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his 	19.293040834062257

 the cold steel pen 	49.18511408227854

 —cracked lookingglass of a servant tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea 	18.46973285057319

 he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman 	18.40587074347168

 his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other 	9.923909549176463

 god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island 	23.753938374165738

 hellenise it 	1030.6739888749962

 cranly’s arm 	150.5041295122935

 his arm 	201.5701929522382

 —and to think of your having to beg from these swine 	24.107159635289964

 i’m the only one that knows what you are 	25.540129734238672

 why don’t you trust me more 	27.677955379208147

 what have you up your nose against me 	29.720921353133768

 is it haines 	122.15848061882276

 if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe 	13.745395784177154

 young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe’s roo <title> palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another 	8.2637400253028

 o i shall expire break the news to her gently aubrey i shall die with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor’s shears 	12.211931668529344

 a scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade 	21.712085346324706

 a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnold’s face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshal <title> to ourselves 	7.79064480062593

 new paganism 	329.38646574608987

 —let him stay stephen said 	33.3065558570608

 there’s nothing wrong with him except at night 	22.127133408499702

 —then what is it 	45.300469568939604

 buck mulligan asked impatiently 	55.80627100931387

 cough it up 	95.34605859795919

 i’m quite frank with you 	17.103794301606968

 what have you against me now 	43.15617532790663

 they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale 	18.582470666701177

 stephen freed his arm quietly 	52.725604667787835

 —do you wish me to tell you 	39.30486122531375

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 —yes what is it 	40.63397826155252

 buck mulligan answered 	83.8626262410683

 i don’t remember anything 	25.546774776490192

 he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke 	33.64071994008109

 a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes 	10.462613112713049

 stephen depressed by his own voice said —do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death 	24.8859817885197

 buck mulligan frowned quickly and said —what 	26.551843522945298

 i can’t remember anything 	32.64311318511642

 i remember only ideas and sensations 	23.784873909240755

 what happened in the name of god 	54.557929307209825

 —you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water 	23.028331919909515

 your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom 	34.65699795714008

 she asked you who was in your room 	57.594001240760804

 buck mulligan said 	45.45250614705178

 what did i say 	67.5346496272248

 i forget 	442.695835144244

 —you said stephen answered o it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead 	16.23702473984921

 a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek 	15.125771304902262

 —did i say that 	61.3326259203939

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 what harm is that 	58.17809494551269

 he shook his constraint from him nervously 	28.600085257631207

 —and what is death he asked your mother’s or yours or my own 	19.925643822420927

 you saw only your mother die 	41.35540600194951

 i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom 	18.38489920130895

 it’s a beastly thing and nothing else 	19.298837550261425

 it simply doesn’t matter 	48.884681274842144

 you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you 	23.85072181019363

 because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only it’s injected the wrong way 	19.878879493573912

 to me it’s all a mockery and beastly 	23.648454389409583

 her cerebral lobes are not functioning 	24.959011508802078

 she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt 	13.142877407815103

 humour her till it’s over 	45.448148113992396

 you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don’t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette’ <initial> absurd i suppose i did say it 	12.604737830175303

 i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother 	17.56176404304008

 he had spoken himself into boldness 	28.858370070881787

 stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly —i am not thinking of the offence to my mother 	19.659522077435902

 —of what then 	75.74212762835049

 —of the offence to me stephen answered 	44.81303595351034

 —o an impossible person he exclaimed 	20.573775746996354

 he walked off quickly round the parapet 	33.05866151449178

 stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland 	25.483921098548922

 sea and headland now grew dim 	23.22891733783913

 pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks 	25.319826591808454

 a voice within the tower called loudly —are you up there mulligan 	20.711454884423535

 —i’m coming buck mulligan answered 	23.068406130019127

 he turned towards stephen and said —look at the sea 	30.99970460365514

 what does it care about offences 	38.85991360230059

 chuck loyola kinch and come on down 	35.56959699295361

 the sassenach wants his morning rashers 	18.717071022392204

 his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof —don’t mope over it all day he said 	22.0209347355399

 i’m inconsequent 	51.385948946846135

 give up the moody brooding 	61.44636542508836

 his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars 	12.837865928058973

 woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed 	23.11262817058041

 inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet 	15.819478969715275

 white breast of the dim sea 	58.31361011622611

 the twining stresses two by two 	16.312947682139118

 a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords 	10.412094698978919

 a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green 	11.354800570916302

 it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters 	22.96965680552235

 fergus’ song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords 	21.889175024407677

 her door was open she wanted to hear my music 	22.98464323504068

 silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside 	29.863263107131292

 she was crying in her wretched bed 	40.161605369429324

 for those words stephen love’s bitter mystery 	27.33881568010264

 where now 	628.8417464510452

 her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer 	6.681585510483765

 a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl 	26.839872556326217

 she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility 	12.78817748508606

 phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed 	41.71554360459968

 and no more turn aside and brood 	22.7061963045623

 folded away in the memory of nature with her toys 	43.184915893339586

 memories beset his brooding brain 	24.03821119881057

 her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament 	25.992642852463405

 a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening 	17.521805555320707

 her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts 	23.502000550916

 in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes 	9.342300699731135

 her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul 	15.049018885332801

 on me alone 	148.13965873255842

 the ghostcandle to light her agony 	22.59432436487173

 ghostly light on the tortured face 	65.49696872814819

 her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees 	11.096751422761455

 her eyes on me to strike me down 	40.10198313139991

 liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat 	7.663499698756188

 ghoul chewer of corpses no mother let me be and let me live 	17.98503421426579

 —kinch ahoy buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower 	18.913026355716713

 it came nearer up the staircase calling again 	29.617781458162522

 stephen still trembling at his soul’s cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words 	19.602772549515198

 —dedalus come down like a good mosey 	48.86534985408287

 breakfast is ready 	78.71657617611395

 haines is apologising for waking us last night 	14.124278907826886

 it’s all right 	25.484076956318646

 —i’m coming stephen said turning 	27.77288897208923

 —do for jesus’ sake buck mulligan said 	17.903354767648974

 for my sake and for all our sakes 	34.68862083776346

 —i told him your symbol of irish art 	21.405612092877703

 he says it’s very clever 	43.964753146175866

 touch him for a quid will you 	42.3578592216261

 a guinea i mean 	51.01281089015408

 —i get paid this morning stephen said 	27.699691562866256

 —the school kip 	54.23431922177166

 buck mulligan said 	45.45250614705178

 how much 	248.1379949010593

 four quid 	435.34726000473677

 lend us one 	138.4631207901359

 —if you want it stephen said 	37.77449292178492

 —four shining sovereigns buck mulligan cried with delight 	20.183516051712516

 we’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids 	13.800011670838334

 four omnipotent sovereigns 	85.83716398707502

 the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet 	22.27242973278885

 why should i bring it down 	36.463252452305746

 or leave it there all day forgotten friendship 	33.91260274700258

 he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck 	16.420390272450874

 so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes 	20.246946191105085

 i am another now and yet the same 	27.012504709111266

 a servant too 	122.50385152927493

 a server of a servant 	58.25361584032596

 in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow 	12.886636901141042

 two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning 	11.036574744316244

 —we’ll be choked buck mulligan said 	18.678432048735306

 haines open that door will you 	28.243533388659557

 stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker 	46.731978719064315

 a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors 	19.432751420957874

 —have you the key 	58.386768041163904

 a voice asked 	82.7025994783974

 —dedalus has it buck mulligan said 	27.313119713032084

 janey mack i’m choked he howled without looking up from the fire —kinch —it’s in the lock stephen said coming forward 	18.176554953992866

 the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered 	12.709140126211409

 haines stood at the doorway looking out 	55.00539591126839

 stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait 	18.919574262843945

 buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him 	22.93169668382624

 then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief 	16.861925237873585

 —i’m melting he said as the candle remarked when 	25.399141730750028

 but hush not a word more on that subject kinch wake up bread butter honey 	16.61965443682476

 haines come in 	132.4415648253776

 the grub is ready 	36.988780169822135

 bless us o lord and these thy gifts 	26.90679712204659

 where’s the sugar 	54.927965962024984

 o jay there’s no milk 	40.497219803702826

 stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker 	30.09399033509015

 buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet 	43.739677151935176

 —what sort of a kip is this 	35.3034110518655

 he said 	73.42341815822552

 i told her to come after eight 	40.84241755496483

 —we can drink it black stephen said thirstily 	28.79852428755207

 there’s a lemon in the locker 	46.36116420715473

 —o damn you and your paris fads buck mulligan said 	16.356242078800435

 i want sandycove milk 	55.47576733809432

 haines came in from the doorway and said quietly —that woman is coming up with the milk 	37.273277996823644

 —the blessings of god on you buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair 	22.41736637084583

 pour out the tea there 	69.2109835534839

 the sugar is in the bag 	63.89362525779087

 here i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs 	28.52582773854553

 he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying — in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti 	12.460102800358502

 haines sat down to pour out the tea 	36.377612919251845

 —i’m giving you two lumps each he said 	14.605484546067439

 but i say mulligan you do make strong tea don’t you 	15.32415512991443

 buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old woman’s wheedling voice —when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said 	17.1069745730006

 and when i makes water i makes water 	21.49033976658178

 —by jove it is tea haines said 	25.727596653566458

 buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling — so i do mrs cahill says she 	15.007638228796997

 begob ma’am says mrs cahill god send you don’t make them in the one pot 	17.471121501491616

 he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife 	14.168106325187969

 —that’s folk he said very earnestly for your book haines 	22.08125074040604

 printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind 	39.06701840338933

 he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows —can you recall brother is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads 	16.36622635294457

 —i doubt it said stephen gravely 	33.34107121072573

 —do you now 	84.83764713119365

 buck mulligan said in the same tone 	47.27168181503326

 your reasons pray 	80.05123148364108

 —i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion 	26.541716894501704

 mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann 	13.872984136545044

 buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight 	28.547749859624147

 —charming he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly 	18.75911878063284

 quite charming then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf —for old mary ann she doesn’t care a damn 	12.38528406923508

 but hising up her petticoats 	53.01616007568755

 he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned 	15.773000607909685

 the doorway was darkened by an entering form 	21.351129810016186

 —the milk sir —come in ma’am mulligan said 	17.67734191889171

 kinch get the jug 	85.97672420513881

 an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow 	31.570229370501462

 —that’s a lovely morning sir she said 	22.044039242355115

 —to whom 	97.42857129025549

 mulligan said glancing at her 	48.07889865675745

 ah to be sure stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker 	27.600988003159987

 —the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces 	16.55821202903013

 —how much sir 	83.108415054845

 asked the old woman 	77.38781573177873

 —a quart stephen said 	38.655513908698126

 he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers 	14.541040842199479

 she poured again a measureful and a tilly 	30.374611118513744

 she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out 	24.56485414140396

 crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs 	13.938333428476517

 they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle 	20.568011183804547

 silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times 	25.908189512311306

 to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour 	11.480759831204976

 —it is indeed ma’am buck mulligan said pouring milk into their cups 	15.533039032492402

 —taste it sir she said 	34.00671693496492

 he drank at her bidding 	60.422483823694094

 —if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts 	17.469869727889908

 living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives’ spits 	12.401844000173528

 —are you a medical student sir 	30.885782971172016

 the old woman asked 	69.05562522142034

 —i am ma’am buck mulligan answered 	21.339969559060318

 —look at that now she said 	42.62284607674322

 stephen listened in scornful silence 	31.86625552095692

 she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights 	14.6776018570582

 to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness the serpent’s prey 	20.679189909256763

 and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes 	14.718378121810076

 —do you understand what he says 	43.60905008832825

 stephen asked her 	112.40502927888446

 —is it french you are talking sir 	34.23501975514768

 the old woman said to haines 	38.13567243561938

 haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently 	31.653814491700807

 —irish buck mulligan said 	36.47074114974954

 —i thought it was irish she said by the sound of it 	32.77963412278492

 are you from the west sir 	59.53533062758152

 —i am an englishman haines answered 	26.263699554751103

 —he’s english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland 	22.060914171962516

 —sure we ought to the old woman said and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself 	21.316322544341567

 i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows 	18.07065776448397

 —grand is no name for it said buck mulligan 	28.33734464668887

 wonderful entirely 	768.6527295832325

 fill us out some more tea kinch 	29.797185031023837

 would you like a cup ma’am 	25.319990155633725

 —no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go 	19.10320664378341

 haines said to her —have you your bill 	47.820436843825554

 we had better pay her mulligan hadn’t we 	18.140679102385104

 stephen filled again the three cups 	54.873253530904435

 —bill sir 	151.2687930069196

 she said halting 	177.6273614506579

 well it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling 	10.723184341530363

 buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets 	11.68470405685901

 —pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling 	33.05601032467311

 buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried —a miracle he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying —ask nothing more of me sweet 	19.96430956366161

 all i can give you i give 	41.82269497236576

 stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand 	29.671745786336206

 —we’ll owe twopence he said 	21.502365363398646

 —time enough sir she said taking the coin 	29.063961169527573

 time enough 	185.90290506224784

 good morning sir 	88.94464422959216

 she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant —heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet 	17.957865345761096

 he turned to stephen and said —seriously dedalus 	23.626399581079262

 i’m stony 	51.37142741850114

 hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money 	18.671210208930834

 today the bards must drink and junket 	18.518899776242936

 ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty 	19.70597667674628

 —that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today 	19.851928546603098

 —our swim first buck mulligan said 	19.32021664591996

 he turned to stephen and asked blandly —is this the day for your monthly wash kinch 	18.384558804731977

 then he said to haines —the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month 	18.3706613862842

 —all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf 	21.634129282677975

 speaking to me 	107.11638884539146

 they wash and tub and scrub 	26.010667860138074

 yet here’s a spot 	59.87379718429955

 —that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good 	17.289342010651595

 buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone —wait till you hear him on hamlet haines 	20.56121200966247

 —well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen 	25.53787864978243

 i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in 	24.47457702215499

 —would i make any money by it 	27.602419999938533

 stephen asked 	239.61935603364861

 he strolled out to the doorway 	53.673499237519444

 buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour —you put your hoof in it now 	18.014078567678933

 what did you say that for 	55.60526825566239

 stephen said 	128.8058105773499

 the problem is to get money 	69.17924439412194

 from whom 	328.5329721039574

 from the milkwoman or from him 	25.195286021547275

 it’s a toss up i think 	20.955744265733347

 —i see little hope stephen said from her or from him 	25.872015685235464

 buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm 	20.801256791604352

 in a suddenly changed tone he added —to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right 	20.178459907498816

 damn all else they are good for 	38.11776924955151

 why don’t you play them as i do 	28.974885528745922

 to hell with them all 	31.154582804006996

 let us get out of the kip 	57.07506593760172

 he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly —mulligan is stripped of his garments 	12.39256347059136

 he emptied his pockets on to the table 	28.015563514479517

 —there’s your snotrag he said 	22.015411361543695

 and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain 	18.326932999247784

 his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief 	21.958579317620043

 god we’ll simply have to dress the character 	27.8828006747216

 i want puce gloves and green boots 	25.524110072936455

 do i contradict myself 	50.39582477889136

 very well then i contradict myself 	33.42800355360791

 mercurial malachi 	662.7953200617438

 a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands 	21.549816631995284

 —and there’s your latin quarter hat he said 	21.55585729760245

 stephen picked it up and put it on 	43.044021417557985

 haines called to them from the doorway —are you coming you fellows 	32.93952386149384

 —i’m ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door 	17.25224454367624

 come out kinch 	154.4848490732895

 you have eaten all we left i suppose 	20.02830589303528

 resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow —and going forth he met butterly 	15.035367771058167

 stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it 	18.305059932001917

 he put the huge key in his inner pocket 	33.674683295525845

 at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked —did you bring the key 	25.26326867553253

 —i have it stephen said preceding them 	38.95092063155164

 he walked on 	64.0634513374772

 behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses 	16.377619430593825

 —twelve quid buck mulligan said 	25.063570005988066

 —to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder 	16.22172734880625

 they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last —rather bleak in wintertime i should say 	10.911149318914509

 martello you call it 	68.1157688149876

 —billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea 	18.73422242201739

 but ours is the omphalos  	79.40612878300084

 —what is your idea of hamlet 	32.723706500662864

 haines asked stephen 	135.479887572843

 —no no buck mulligan shouted in pain 	31.657421816520042

 i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up 	14.673482077327458

 wait till i have a few pints in me first 	33.462088787192826

 he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat —you couldn’t manage it under three pints kinch could you 	13.87033225940987

 —it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer 	20.86823041835298

 —you pique my curiosity haines said amiably 	19.59136236095862

 is it some paradox 	66.90776366691904

 —pooh buck mulligan said 	34.83971480819559

 we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes 	33.895913948042036

 it’s quite simple 	40.63595756418668

 he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father 	20.472151075601296

 haines said beginning to point at stephen 	35.00166505393365

 he himself 	344.2808779027162

 buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephen’s ear —o shade of kinch the elder japhet in search of a father —we’re always tired in the morning stephen said to haines 	13.845051140704944

 and it is rather long to tell 	32.74132547504853

 buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands 	20.62706500241072

 —the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said 	11.013824284299673

 —i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore 	15.462036536964538

 that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it 	18.304187190449078

 buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak 	19.22975522723486

 in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires 	13.010699673884448

 eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent 	14.855372268206892

 the seas’ ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins 	18.7298000327089

 —i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused 	28.096433443482123

 the father and the son idea 	81.46640203472519

 the son striving to be atoned with the father 	31.224213726036147

 buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face 	22.415143448432243

 he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety 	10.496286887935405

 he moved a doll’s head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice —i’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard 	12.891088360542735

 my mother’s a jew my father’s a bird 	27.788772735878933

 with joseph the joiner i cannot agree 	17.127942352257993

 so here’s to disciples and calvary 	22.481708720958043

 —if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again 	15.346276109218403

 he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted —goodbye now goodbye write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead 	13.288842193656526

 what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet’s breezy 	22.426085795622285

 goodbye now goodbye he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries 	10.250868043427081

 he’s rather blasphemous 	44.693251315909905

 i’m not a believer myself that is to say 	16.8008751277172

 what did he call it 	43.08353422120841

 joseph the joiner 	83.76334484512279

 —o haines said you have heard it before 	36.16163772569781

 —three times a day after meals stephen said drily 	33.428903655929375

 —you’re not a believer are you 	21.30802442838615

 haines asked 	452.0985416636436

 i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word 	30.832537658035722

 creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god 	25.18952590727524

 —there’s only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said 	25.756630849582404

 haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone 	19.230857644696403

 he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it 	24.078672532068605

 —thank you stephen said taking a cigarette 	38.8636510170741

 haines helped himself and snapped the case to 	29.732791218818534

 he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands 	14.765812774338324

 —yes of course he said as they went on again 	34.789976074186185

 either you believe or you don’t isn’t it 	18.56695056817093

 personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal god 	27.654661625104072

 you don’t stand for that i suppose 	32.94939484377209

 —you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought 	13.878891345128238

 he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side 	21.6763765512888

 its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels 	19.010208367885497

 my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen a wavering line along the path 	12.289250754907318

 they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark 	26.31674159917758

 he wants that key 	54.83911762541895

 it is mine 	120.01624763849806

 i paid the rent 	60.151642946631576

 now i eat his salt bread 	23.837821762229755

 give him the key too 	66.17951405768586

 he will ask for it 	42.085593866222275

 that was in his eyes 	46.46714875365904

 —after all haines began 	49.27964236585548

 stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind 	27.117433864218324

 —after all i should think you are able to free yourself 	31.386128915560978

 —i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian 	19.543575881055745

 haines said 	271.9373518521539

 a crazy queen old and jealous 	23.60896263374881

 kneel down before me 	61.4831416424518

 —and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs 	28.442797179280134

 haines said again 	168.6009437997077

 what do you mean 	53.85687663541615

 —the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church 	13.639212255831296

 haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke 	17.95244201093923

 —i can quite understand that he said calmly 	37.36035035181706

 an irishman must think like that i daresay 	30.221543511943793

 we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly 	16.04756437833973

 it seems history is to blame 	29.28937154535269

 the proud potent titles clanged over stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars 	7.029254831379313

 symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs 	10.223733148433498

 a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christ’s terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son 	11.9219903769627

 words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger 	17.18744140017721

 idle mockery 	543.6157712427934

 the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michael’s host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields 	12.392907719598796

 hear hear prolonged applause 	38.671213470590104

 zut nom de dieu —of course i’m a britisher haines’s voice said and i feel as one 	21.51756386794074

 i don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either 	16.975894670709003

 that’s our national problem i’m afraid just now 	16.863727135465002

 two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman 	25.636545104049574

 —she’s making for bullock harbour 	31.236001049937933

 the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain 	35.79820379913189

 —there’s five fathoms out there he said 	23.264134543382525

 it’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one 	18.78031875400835

 it’s nine days today 	32.289321125426866

 the man that was drowned 	56.63631782628111

 a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite 	12.840850081852139

 here i am 	89.64367429844188

 buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder 	12.69391389202685

 a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water 	15.978569769190191

 —is the brother with you malachi 	51.34186134840278

 —down in westmeath 	112.49467158185473

 with the bannons 	164.302815108715

 —still there 	139.74117112589255

 i got a card from bannon 	52.99130446304524

 says he found a sweet young thing down there 	25.00867121093442

 photo girl he calls her 	42.52373962481139

 —snapshot eh 	147.1326160114182

 brief exposure 	347.4505779181273

 buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots 	20.882484738854323

 an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face 	12.07105175478458

 he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth 	12.376861538819467

 buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone 	12.657631536823818

 —seymour’s back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock 	17.29587881703612

 chucked medicine and going in for the army 	49.3665272797776

 —ah go to god buck mulligan said 	31.97564124382987

 —going over next week to stew 	22.989858923147633

 you know that red carlisle girl lily 	18.897693627150495

 —spooning with him last night on the pier 	52.867586201605015

 the father is rotto with money 	25.86590363228908

 —is she up the pole 	72.63962415209616

 —better ask seymour that 	34.29393855274143

 —seymour a bleeding officer buck mulligan said 	17.43282328442933

 he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely —redheaded women buck like goats 	15.857607547667715

 he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt 	20.57502801709473

 —my twelfth rib is gone he cried 	18.799401189300067

 i’m the übermensch 	26.77159563766618

 toothless kinch and i the supermen 	50.100022459363565

 he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay 	24.662056865021352

 —are you going in here malachi 	35.72300093509444

 make room in the bed 	78.09041148141193

 the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes 	16.03169450939609

 haines sat down on a stone smoking 	52.48845286881819

 —are you not coming in 	36.80019233291963

 —later on haines said 	43.1749003082291

 not on my breakfast 	90.55619375097324

 stephen turned away 	121.7252514240678

 —i’m going mulligan he said 	18.05996065439344

 —give us that key kinch buck mulligan said to keep my chemise flat 	18.234857337130645

 stephen handed him the key 	61.03301334045766

 buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes 	20.273419043919233

 —and twopence he said for a pint 	49.95036991146954

 throw it there 	147.57701505069792

 stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap 	38.282537860849665

 dressing undressing 	543.6243941648513

 buck mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly —he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord 	16.754577270877306

 thus spake zarathustra 	127.44735828388211

 his plump body plunged 	38.71802922715435

 —we’ll see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish 	14.654062369977835

 horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a saxon 	49.619244905119544

 —the ship buck mulligan cried 	39.574096495379855

 half twelve 	412.4695435453544

 —good stephen said 	58.13429926653962

 he walked along the upwardcurving path 	30.486516308141937

 iubilantium te virginum 	92.13254237640518

 the priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly 	21.58961522475335

 i will not sleep here tonight 	28.513691144791608

 home also i cannot go 	29.567082886609576

 a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea 	22.07508184369206

 turning the curve he waved his hand 	18.24494371998351

 it called again 	92.39661601425007

 a sleek brown head a seal’s far out on the water round 	25.563232494624074

 <number> —you cochrane what city sent for him 	20.481593991126132

 —tarentum sir 	121.54839696174834

 —very good 	116.40462877915812

 —there was a battle sir 	43.65532086039166

 —very good 	116.40462877915812

 the boy’s blank face asked the blank window 	26.88435112200852

 fabled by the daughters of memory 	72.66254241665507

 and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it 	23.32143748065631

 a phrase then of impatience thud of blake’s wings of excess 	14.43714371273084

 what’s left us then 	41.34603620183314

 —i forget the place sir 	58.77709590784543

 <number> <initial> <initial> —asculum stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book 	26.114235447453602

 —yes sir 	54.8737000745807

 and he said another victory like that and we are done for 	28.525928178580404

 that phrase the world had remembered 	34.9073409616241

 a dull ease of the mind 	56.77202371298332

 from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear 	13.057274955187404

 any general to any officers 	35.16833025367506

 they lend ear 	113.64746435076216

 —you armstrong stephen said 	36.8931053595255

 what was the end of pyrrhus 	52.90727105687567

 —end of pyrrhus sir 	56.72552968839999

 —i know sir 	80.62421399618125

 ask me sir comyn said 	38.01387845188874

 you armstrong 	465.4378135429902

 do you know anything about pyrrhus 	31.862575591933325

 a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong’s satchel 	17.214509892783575

 he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly 	12.801607858090142

 crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips 	50.49945358361234

 a sweetened boy’s breath 	44.5353251846323

 welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy 	25.29038712297958

 vico road dalkey 	164.83644666929456

 —pyrrhus sir 	143.75486687736384

 pyrrhus a pier 	122.8430304116198

 all laughed 	475.68996541215

 mirthless high malicious laughter 	49.34425682365803

 armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile 	18.50439953101765

 in a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay 	14.807242420204297

 —tell me now stephen said poking the boy’s shoulder with the book what is a pier 	34.03178352719903

 —a pier sir armstrong said 	27.751057133049102

 a thing out in the water 	69.21996978752695

 a kind of a bridge 	68.59478627265244

 kingstown pier sir 	113.06851112305736

 some laughed again mirthless but with meaning 	21.5149318196544

 two in the back bench whispered 	61.15477168136604

 they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent 	21.36843856895589

 with envy he watched their faces edith ethel gerty lily 	11.898669203181441

 their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle 	10.867227220413193

 —kingstown pier stephen said 	36.78704045420489

 yes a disappointed bridge 	46.9385221024724

 —how sir 	151.73504042655705

 comyn asked 	755.4828671313926

 a bridge is across a river 	24.974603055739088

 for haines’s chapbook 	85.63205854449676

 no one here to hear 	52.037903152102814

 tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind 	14.127788462202298

 what then 	480.6121027307328

 a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement master’s praise 	17.77199623740803

 why had they chosen all that part 	28.956110840503648

 not wholly for the smooth caress 	56.54894175927271

 for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop 	16.137879188363478

 had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death 	11.470842410420477

 they are not to be thought away 	46.83588406493935

 time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted 	24.51778156460437

 but can those have been possible seeing that they never were 	24.77321062537404

 or was that only possible which came to pass 	27.24717797633115

 weave weaver of the wind 	76.64888091928069

 —tell us a story sir 	55.87988050652754

 —o do sir 	70.31766778926702

 a ghoststory 	403.3949767527216

 —where do you begin in this 	35.653278800790595

 stephen asked opening another book 	32.966089753051904

 — weep no more comyn said 	36.65637351528529

 —go on then talbot 	54.779863746139945

 —and the story sir 	70.68781710564498

 —after stephen said 	56.99806667336738

 go on talbot 	148.10338530285995

 a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel 	15.05010621359626

 he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text —weep no more woful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 	9.499903231083664

 it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible 	19.48833071387258

 aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night 	15.172780261678104

 by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy 	10.915794426215081

 fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds 	10.015590448119394

 thought is the thought of thought 	73.4666151146751

 tranquil brightness 	624.1166306296877

 the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of for <title> tranquility sudden vast candescent form of for <title> talbot repeated —through the dear might of him that walked the waves through the dear might 	15.437440863180077

 —turn over stephen said quietly 	47.950342653132516

 i don’t see anything 	27.658286175262354

 —what sir 	123.20725732488243

 talbot asked simply bending forward 	26.05083925604581

 his hand turned the page over 	43.52909988296013

 he leaned back and went on again having just remembered 	25.440379523569295

 of him that walked the waves 	26.488816449554317

 it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute 	20.835345807566686

 riddle me riddle me randy ro 	22.144969016273485

 my father gave me seeds to sow 	27.75435853905089

 —have i heard all 	79.02665362482577

 stephen asked 	239.61935603364861

 —yes sir 	54.8737000745807

 hockey at ten sir 	70.98473617796976

 —half day sir 	61.31255225571072

 —who can answer a riddle 	30.8178149810576

 stephen asked 	239.61935603364861

 they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling 	10.572622269010468

 crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily —a riddle sir 	10.390648779464485

 ask me sir 	98.16490882666847

 —o ask me sir 	40.84854216286253

 —a hard one sir 	46.60832322560536

 —this is the riddle stephen said the cock crew the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven 	13.204389514481232

 ’tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven 	17.899285404532872

 what is that 	70.73157342068424

 —what sir 	123.20725732488243

 —again sir 	117.51540624005867

 we didn’t hear 	54.195486451862244

 their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated 	23.812697674010554

 after a silence cochrane said —what is it sir 	28.539976862828514

 we give it up 	76.35427432897478

 stephen his throat itching answered —the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush 	17.974351689643264

 he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay 	14.501695389112598

 a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called —hockey they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them 	17.338768950520112

 quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues 	17.192846511906293

 sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook 	13.897700605242754

 his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading 	9.696424142485172

 on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snail’s bed 	12.032149871471386

 he held out his copybook 	61.150492369596805

 the word sums was written on the headline 	33.556277071316075

 beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot 	14.189247199550733

 cyril sargent his name and seal 	52.13907996227615

 —mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir 	31.257992630964566

 stephen touched the edges of the book 	44.46037145235393

 —do you understand how to do them now 	36.5779533172109

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 —numbers eleven to fifteen sargent answered 	18.277747226162113

 mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir 	29.44099064910161

 —can you do them yourself 	51.01383483263579

 stephen asked 	239.61935603364861

 —no sir 	137.86780850140968

 ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snail’s bed 	15.153900527047576

 yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart 	27.863186637622718

 but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail 	18.550313101956817

 she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own 	14.76058736383815

 was that then real 	64.27994034450107

 the only true thing in life 	30.89011495281619

 his mother’s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode 	13.40542002006341

 she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes 	16.405250975989873

 she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been 	15.266591193404045

 a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped 	11.246758993768491

 sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem 	29.78480205426432

 he proves by algebra that shakespeare’s ghost is hamlet’s grandfather 	20.44118663039563

 sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses 	26.592954182754315

 hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field 	33.093679668149846

 across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes 	11.563922018030231

 give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors 	15.904474354019705

 gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend 	11.423021702632544

 —do you understand now 	55.62269716548792

 can you work the second for yourself 	36.02751473057786

 —yes sir 	54.8737000745807

 waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin 	12.51208404705388

 with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands 	13.348749181679555

 like him was i these sloping shoulders this gracelessness 	20.42745102024004

 my childhood bends beside me 	26.326945193508596

 too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly 	29.453309462112596

 mine is far and his secret as our eyes 	27.41653346858633

 secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned 	13.910123147229957

 the sum was done 	49.60802239449014

 —it is very simple stephen said as he stood up 	32.03820759984844

 —yes sir 	54.8737000745807

 thanks sargent answered 	114.97854481171908

 he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench 	18.058010384759214

 —you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form 	25.42016321679595

 —yes sir 	54.8737000745807

 in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield 	24.74545402957844

 —sargent —run on stephen said 	27.649358141524782

 mr deasy is calling you 	32.04656940543563

 he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife 	14.129082765146082

 they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet 	9.817427475710282

 he turned his angry white moustache 	26.19054410386972

 —what is it now 	47.82245180719012

 he cried continually without listening 	33.712023559515416

 —cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said 	18.748224252002586

 —will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here 	22.17191449038065

 and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly —what is the matter 	19.093605120705526

 what is it now 	70.07279633477008

 their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head 	11.746885147919867

 as on the first day he bargained with me here 	30.878489294164023

 as it was in the beginning is now 	37.89882999398786

 on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be 	11.679921869190048

 and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end 	10.752552634427595

 a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor 	31.96315293535103

 blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table 	22.367282258275885

 —first our little financial settlement he said 	13.846615962851287

 he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong 	25.928853844326728

 it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table 	16.62088637927588

 —two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away 	19.82257539202912

 and now his strongroom for the gold 	29.216901899326327

 stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emir’s turban and this the scallop of saint james 	10.424063963841721

 an old pilgrim’s hoard dead treasure hollow shells 	20.54696280728448

 a sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth 	30.46422767082186

 —three mr deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand 	21.357622827009724

 these are handy things to have 	20.638870415875605

 this is for sovereigns 	62.47399713826616

 this is for shillings 	62.44319382040282

 sixpences halfcrowns 	863.154543122905

 and here crowns 	109.01963833901955

 he shot from it two crowns and two shillings 	22.56158466810471

 —three twelve he said 	36.57347267869825

 i think you’ll find that’s right 	29.96998075570063

 —thank you sir stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers 	18.563417104934977

 —no thanks at all mr deasy said 	23.62317120452535

 you have earned it 	48.4545744035187

 stephen’s hand free again went back to the hollow shells 	25.32740837077488

 symbols too of beauty and of power 	46.81237608181132

 a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery 	16.680376154931974

 —don’t carry it like that mr deasy said 	24.26950146356447

 you’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it 	22.356388787376034

 you just buy one of these machines 	41.21700195365385

 you’ll find them very handy 	23.110176100103676

 answer something 	222.77886552348224

 —mine would be often empty stephen said 	26.83844545365047

 the same room and hour the same wisdom and i the same 	24.091194803800136

 three times now 	152.02104831702508

 three nooses round me here 	29.243067121539845

 i can break them in this instant if i will 	32.990029728497525

 —because you don’t save mr deasy said pointing his finger 	20.78731241686297

 you don’t know yet what money is 	16.12023394959186

 money is power 	89.31698147331834

 when you have lived as long as i have 	31.068313991634312

 i know i know 	62.06497888419402

 but what does shakespeare say 	55.514409739838904

 put but money in thy purse 	21.159016921225223

 —iago stephen murmured 	60.05857896657496

 he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare 	33.578654153660835

 he made money 	155.4780482073409

 a poet yes but an englishman too 	30.29946028480859

 do you know what is the pride of the english 	37.06594925187915

 do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman’s mouth 	20.789286236209275

 the seas’ ruler 	36.910494993805905

 his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating 	19.416427086428918

 —that on his empire stephen said the sun never sets 	36.15150770203558

 —ba mr deasy cried 	58.545472196978785

 that’s not english 	38.764536007232934

 a french celt said that 	27.165222819932865

 he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail 	25.56397848925491

 —i will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast 	28.068333284370667

 i paid my way 	36.63102431898393

 good man good man 	60.094451370154125

 —i paid my way 	35.29936737804347

 the lump i have is useless 	37.843617903967335

 —for the moment no stephen answered 	37.77999142445797

 mr deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox 	16.887577360926706

 —i knew you couldn’t he said joyously 	34.089901651795365

 but one day you must feel it 	42.926902355998685

 we are a generous people but we must also be just 	16.790083923024103

 —i fear those big words stephen said which make us so unhappy 	21.038530887970953

 mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward prince of wales 	14.63174274852816

 —you think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said 	17.848014863761954

 i saw three generations since o’connell’s time 	24.48640298016737

 i remember the famine in ’ <number>  	23.139589375419433

 do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before o’connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue 	14.964745357929141

 you fenians forget some things 	24.117242698431593

 glorious pious and immortal memory 	36.38607568979637

 the lodge of diamond in armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes 	8.303246026463933

 hoarse masked and armed the planters’ covenant 	13.268690815633937

 the black north and true blue bible 	26.44258722113516

 croppies lie down 	159.0619267600688

 stephen sketched a brief gesture 	39.97634492261324

 —i have rebel blood in me too mr deasy said 	21.585113902569553

 on the spindle side 	53.19312923106015

 but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union 	22.49728471499084

 we are all irish all kings’ sons 	19.450291413923736

 — per vias rectas mr deasy said firmly was his motto 	17.037650699938762

 he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so 	22.316954014595503

 lal the ral the ra the rocky road to dublin 	13.264729553503642

 a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots 	10.289734235030645

 lal the ral the raddy 	32.01593618956502

 —that reminds me mr deasy said 	22.839631781321152

 you can do me a favour mr dedalus with some of your literary friends 	23.37960240229341

 i have a letter here for the press 	48.55121558099976

 sit down a moment 	97.53789147432349

 i have just to copy the end 	28.791100341934847

 he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter 	27.2397108984273

 —sit down 	110.44306382262283

 excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense 	20.20684106906174

 just a moment 	90.89971332615336

 he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error 	13.088519819879343

 stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence 	22.932719897834872

 framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord hastings’ repulse the duke of westminster’s shotover the duke of beaufort’s ceylon prix de paris 1866 	8.499491122705951

 elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign 	28.663406019449504

 he saw their speeds backing king’s colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds 	16.14903344555142

 —full stop mr deasy bade his keys 	24.400831280624555

 but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question 	24.288492071821278

 where cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush 	12.31119880677951

 even money fair rebel 	52.853224339413664

 ten to one the field 	45.17390075138519

 dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butcher’s dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange 	8.355085413006316

 shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle 	23.461785278436075

 again a goal 	82.76196688498442

 you mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick 	19.806827287682346

 time shocked rebounds shock by shock 	15.51542022684313

 jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts 	11.018871474061926

 —now then mr deasy said rising 	35.28517626711109

 he came to the table pinning together his sheets 	24.567913450890718

 stephen stood up 	92.13182371790842

 —i have put the matter into a nutshell mr deasy said 	23.844222970805607

 it’s about the foot and mouth disease 	21.490154210912312

 just look through it 	49.63064030499372

 he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke 	18.336939404672485

 —mark my words mr dedalus he said 	28.367546491970472

 england is in the hands of the jews 	64.54047845702715

 in all the highest places her finance her press 	20.70913475254515

 and they are the signs of a nation’s decay 	47.21922166778667

 wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength 	23.85422836509447

 i have seen it coming these years 	22.502331347102704

 as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction 	16.73044469939951

 old england is dying 	53.239266067857

 he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam 	21.29813252242186

 he faced about and back again 	29.126500979475807

 —dying he said again if not dead by now 	33.19796383601699

 his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted 	14.832399372845018

 —a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not 	13.693482276929588

 —they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely 	27.791924380817385

 and you can see the darkness in their eyes 	40.29599647548927

 and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day 	30.737643325741306

 on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers 	11.571288176329183

 gabble of geese 	164.78816610143218

 they swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats 	11.055551337419056

 not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures 	14.274820925619707

 their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain 	8.02742486887194

 vain patience to heap and hoard 	21.376865189530065

 time surely would scatter all 	22.753871657908324

 a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on 	16.246544574979307

 their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh 	13.068885725238832

 —who has not 	71.9303163998168

 stephen said 	128.8058105773499

 —what do you mean 	48.78003767702129

 mr deasy asked 	97.46974246315459

 he came forward a pace and stood by the table 	29.54562964040883

 his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly 	19.01460763568117

 is this old wisdom 	69.32557083694189

 he waits to hear from me 	36.705924336545934

 —history stephen said is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake 	32.66782802994944

 from the playfield the boys raised a shout 	21.692025776114054

 a whirring whistle goal 	38.690930616431785

 what if that nightmare gave you a back kick 	28.939408547416896

 —the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said 	20.407548120284982

 all human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of god 	9.617977250670865

 stephen jerked his thumb towards the window saying —that is god 	35.210406298406035

 hooray ay whrrwhee —what 	29.83589174706202

 mr deasy asked 	97.46974246315459

 —a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders 	26.78243517617374

 mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers 	18.658184280097075

 looking up again he set them free 	39.725643622444025

 —i am happier than you are he said 	23.48484465008214

 we have committed many errors and many sins 	18.95123323862273

 a woman brought sin into the world 	24.42298901241091

 for a woman who was no better than she should be helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks made war on troy 	12.254680574947562

 a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here macmurrough’s wife and her leman o’rourke prince of breffni 	14.364339827375762

 a woman too brought parnell low 	24.37993553526234

 many errors many failures but not the one sin 	24.783053755810904

 i am a struggler now at the end of my days 	24.503761981897224

 but i will fight for the right till the end 	52.3849997454238

 for ulster will fight and ulster will be right 	21.68338476400795

 —well sir he began 	40.47429788219937

 —i foresee mr deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work 	17.296322030311387

 you were not born to be a teacher i think 	25.19921823676958

 perhaps i am wrong 	122.29675761747767

 —a learner rather stephen said 	19.68831078518399

 and here what will you learn more 	34.49939135455331

 mr deasy shook his head 	33.84995344374898

 —who knows 	135.76883001342978

 he said 	73.42341815822552

 to learn one must be humble 	37.90249573444535

 but life is the great teacher 	92.43323151487438

 stephen rustled the sheets again 	35.8645005532382

 —as regards these he began 	29.806210149562553

 —yes mr deasy said 	31.948109098972154

 irish homestead 	316.24063872036453

 —i will try stephen said and let you know tomorrow 	38.94120374957347

 i know two editors slightly 	29.824713746573778

 —that will do mr deasy said briskly 	27.752402660243206

 i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting 	28.69899872723983

 you see if you can get it into your two papers 	30.916308367849005

 what are they 	149.76129843913435

 —the evening telegraph 	66.51179555458187

 —that will do mr deasy said 	23.698285598123046

 there is no time to lose 	44.57801451317463

 now i have to answer that letter from my cousin 	32.592943639762304

 —good morning sir stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket 	24.5334378083779

 thank you 	181.75464224880886

 —not at all mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk 	24.100300555614417

 i like to break a lance with you old as i am 	22.28540556296074

 —good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back 	24.5348589889061

 he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield 	17.686455946729275

 the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors 	25.36854818618165

 still i will help him in his fight 	59.15959773213147

 mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard 	19.237642884020126

 —mr dedalus running after me 	43.17501738826622

 no more letters i hope 	37.14273199429465

 —just one moment 	78.9158776690827

 —yes sir stephen said turning back at the gate 	32.04321869327124

 mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath 	13.904334398526382

 —i just wanted to say he said 	38.48859841316493

 ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews 	18.07968981651563

 do you know that 	36.69989710616883

 and do you know why 	62.95308431934124

 he frowned sternly on the bright air 	46.896257437909455

 —why sir 	150.5647620391736

 stephen asked beginning to smile 	49.42891616315095

 —because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly 	33.29885495154145

 a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm 	15.392461908394992

 he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air 	13.683889438420248

 —she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path 	20.389627319878137

 that’s why 	42.1302161469672

 on his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins 	14.267414453754292

 <number> ineluctable modality of the visible at least that if no more thought through my eyes 	18.32573970312325

 their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand trotting sniffing on all sides 	10.936077426551604

 looking for something lost in a past life 	38.489287734413594

 suddenly he made off like a bounding hare ears flung back chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull 	14.16955400011361

 the man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears 	16.023979775440353

 at the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs seawardpointed ears 	17.33902416472558

 his snout lifted barked at the wavenoise herds of seamorse 	14.948764196062099

 they serpented towards his feet curling unfurling many crests every ninth breaking plashing from far from farther out waves and waves 	8.915367836052317

 they waded a little way in the water and stooping soused their bags and lifting them again waded out 	13.538870834636327

 the dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning 	12.039376571733186

 unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws 	18.45350271614695

 his speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop 	21.213441656451227

 —tatters out of that you mongrel the cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand crouched in flight 	13.750409203777746

 he slunk back in a curve 	58.82061220922987

 doesn’t see me 	43.68004515165047

 along by the edge of the mole he lolloped dawdled smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it 	13.968345858329112

 the simple pleasures of the poor 	45.459821201519865

 his hindpaws then scattered the sand then his forepaws dabbled and delved 	9.070729759723097

 something he buried there his grandmother 	28.108890493741175

 and no more turn aside and brood 	22.7061963045623

 his gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots a buck’s castoffs nebeneinander  	20.787761849938313

 he counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another’s foot had nested warm 	10.737803894578768

 it flows purling widely flowing floating foampool flower unfurling 	9.51079726784721

 under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms hising up their petticoats in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds 	6.61253267036029

 he liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods’ roes 	6.09275849608176

 most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine 	12.960829254473737

 kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray 	25.575530101894653

 gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere 	21.285040195578596

 another slice of bread and butter three four right 	19.838055844243236

 she didn’t like her plate full 	24.264672451218296

 he turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire 	21.488335964513084

 —mrkgnao the cat cried 	52.486079552258246

 they call them stupid 	78.01703539533165

 they understand what we say better than we understand them 	20.720106468120203

 she understands all she wants to 	26.987059064200775

 vindictive too 	1034.0706358312295

 her nature 	296.9399892167438

 curious mice never squeal 	53.625754000810964

 seem to like it 	65.80057529482012

 wonder what i look like to her 	64.13756158486736

 height of a tower 	152.82044574423102

 no she can jump me 	39.45624286019216

 —afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly 	60.3076881473649

 afraid of the chookchooks 	224.30810099983793

 i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens 	28.91562549676077

 —mrkrgnao the cat said loudly 	34.01533665161977

 she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth 	12.201698540893217

 he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones 	14.105338651673899

 then he went to the dresser took the jug hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor 	17.059562396607074

 —gurrhr she cried running to lap 	28.545850665803503

 he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly 	14.237252352489486

 wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after 	24.66349549875199

 they shine in the dark perhaps the tips 	37.06897675694412

 or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps 	39.936467652513166

 he listened to her licking lap 	53.288346769467076

 ham and eggs no 	75.77450328638675

 no good eggs with this drouth 	37.37210038072264

 want pure fresh water 	43.276488400174536

 thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckley’ <initial> fried with butter a shake of pepper 	16.833008734919154

 better a pork kidney at dlugacz’ <initial> while the kettle is boiling 	19.061109340878797

 she lapped slower then licking the saucer clean 	14.096871764418381

 why are their tongues so rough 	28.625548024659246

 nothing she can eat 	62.37727636372491

 he glanced round him 	53.754563286205176

 on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door 	22.941105149329875

 she might like something tasty 	40.81047991643301

 thin bread and butter she likes in the morning 	23.134503846911866

 still perhaps once in a way 	44.01824647664803

 be back in a minute 	55.78815062323741

 a sleepy soft grunt answered —mn 	17.342122430138062

 she didn’t want anything 	36.1240791679874

 he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled 	21.750731846602346

 all the way from gibraltar 	60.40665549578213

 forgotten any little spanish she knew 	17.991987618239694

 wonder what her father gave for it 	34.3219254603925

 old style 	386.73461899904106

 ah yes of course 	54.55106308269697

 bought it at the governor’s auction 	67.83060606232415

 got a short knock 	80.609993813332

 hard as nails at a bargain old tweedy 	25.666388826260523

 yes sir 	191.803421016293

 at plevna that was 	34.38291096431064

 i rose from the ranks sir and i’m proud of it 	21.71285116904639

 still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps 	29.318237891749515

 his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof 	17.78224088067341

 stamps stickyback pictures 	74.1011440008882

 daresay lots of officers are in the swim too 	32.71682294312046

 course they do 	94.67520038012978

 the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely plasto’s high grade ha 	24.072402650863946

 he peeped quickly inside the leather headband 	17.454111217738237

 white slip of paper 	35.21743800242873

 quite safe 	490.37262979042595

 on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey 	29.553755275742535

 not there 	316.13119181887

 in the trousers i left off 	40.14057895627521

 must get it 	105.38101053525199

 potato i have 	90.73719092849319

 creaky wardrobe 	863.1565155324968

 no use disturbing her 	46.55890345435113

 he pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid 	12.14167470726703

 looked shut 	215.35471944074425

 all right till i come back anyhow 	56.15744024092932

 he crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive 	18.808544552635237

 the sun was nearing the steeple of george’s church 	16.19433244894309

 be a warm day i fancy 	48.15456121809947

 specially in these black clothes feel it more 	20.73108439128717

 black conducts reflects refracts is it 	13.68574163586396

 the heat 	333.9345775216881

 but i couldn’t go in that light suit 	33.94829547714153

 make a picnic of it 	40.92489147072103

 his eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth 	16.298073825341564

 boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot 	14.136428595961725

 makes you feel young 	73.90922236528206

 somewhere in the east early morning set off at dawn 	30.10669888249278

 travel round in front of the sun steal a day’s march on him 	27.70781867631105

 keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically 	25.50024137117769

 walk along a strand strange land come to a city gate sentry there old ranker too old tweedy’s big moustaches leaning on a long kind of a spear 	15.171297153836802

 wander through awned streets 	47.04289025664012

 turbaned faces going by 	65.39386877550979

 dark caves of carpet shops big man turko the terrible seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe 	6.778978031337117

 cries of sellers in the streets 	60.96412240896007

 drink water scented with fennel sherbet 	22.037607229171865

 dander along all day 	66.02301761084689

 might meet a robber or two 	27.06889339171124

 well meet him 	113.28130113870752

 getting on to sundown 	116.61378436393346

 the shadows of the mosques among the pillars priest with a scroll rolled up 	21.841141580471252

 a shiver of the trees signal the evening wind 	34.613527965577404

 a mother watches me from her doorway 	40.765442386744475

 she calls her children home in their dark language 	29.950317074044555

 high wall beyond strings twanged 	26.823475184465167

 night sky moon violet colour of molly’s new garters 	17.76943664255149

 a girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them dulcimers 	21.85528528159105

 i pass 	571.622653755221

 probably not a bit like it really 	64.3608163337756

 kind of stuff you read in the track of the sun 	39.5345631319589

 sunburst on the titlepage 	273.5367487142334

 he smiled pleasing himself 	48.082023821058115

 what arthur griffith said about the headpiece over the freeman leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of ireland 	15.335478407106503

 he prolonged his pleased smile 	30.84256443586868

 ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest 	20.665697322014523

 he approached larry o’rourke’ <initial> from the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter 	16.434383519053625

 through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush 	11.909554563698695

 good house however just the end of the city traffic 	29.565793331166606

 for instance m’auley’s down there <initial> <initial> as position 	27.69925490735195

 of course if they ran a tramline along the north circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot 	16.86669624968676

 cute old codger 	155.28513495374335

 no use canvassing him for an ad 	34.67233021803692

 still he knows his own business best 	40.4626191570051

 there he is sure enough my bold larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket 	11.363420407600636

 simon dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up 	27.662339622639852

 do you know what i’m going to tell you 	20.81720475527843

 what’s that mr o’rourke 	34.91438987849467

 do you know what 	32.2108983216412

 the russians they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the japanese 	22.307141723832597

 stop and say a word about the funeral perhaps 	42.412942681862226

 sad thing about poor dignam mr o’rourke 	23.75249603083274

 turning into dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway —good day mr o’rourke 	17.850512562876393

 —good day to you 	42.87854584540099

 —lovely weather sir 	67.08626127810489

 —’tis all that 	67.65634268403169

 where do they get the money 	57.02498163822639

 coming up redheaded curates from the county leitrim rinsing empties and old man in the cellar 	17.822398876758964

 then think of the competition 	148.1786261876496

 general thirst 	639.4674758640247

 good puzzle would be cross dublin without passing a pub 	18.265234358775583

 put down three and carry five 	35.319286815240126

 what is that a bob here and there dribs and drabs 	22.00447627532788

 on the wholesale orders perhaps 	36.283563490997814

 doing a double shuffle with the town travellers 	34.80388883588303

 square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job see 	24.48762512526903

 how much would that tot to off the porter in the month 	25.664754328101445

 say ten barrels of stuff 	31.261423213402335

 say he got ten per cent off 	33.56433546193462

 o more 	625.0628252054772

 he passed saint joseph’s national school 	33.33712506530265

 brats’ clamour 	133.8078211742517

 windows open 	299.4843429677142

 slieve bloom 	609.0508661728176

 he halted before dlugacz’s window staring at the hanks of sausages polonies black and white 	15.432441549748862

 fifteen multiplied by 	107.45318716757336

 the figures whitened in his mind unsolved displeased he let them fade 	18.988505413578064

 the shiny links packed with forcemeat fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood 	8.535221250588823

 a kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish the last 	14.773265925184866

 he stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter 	37.46871509833945

 and a pound and a half of denny’s sausages 	33.93540892601592

 she does whack it by george 	36.81392982735656

 the way her crooked skirt swings at each whack 	17.381449393338983

 the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers sausagepink 	12.699669584655853

 sound meat there like a stallfed heifer 	28.722846733827055

 he took a page up from the pile of cut sheets the model farm at kinnereth on the lakeshore of tiberias 	11.967627132943555

 can become ideal winter sanatorium 	27.103320028198617

 he held the page from him interesting read it nearer the title the blurred cropping cattle the page rustling 	10.852585412714303

 a young white heifer 	57.9388255420216

 those mornings in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens branded sheep flop and fall of dung the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter there’s a prime one unpeeled switches in their hands 	8.698390445739147

 he held the page aslant patiently bending his senses and his will his soft subject gaze at rest 	11.621687070498474

 the crooked skirt swinging whack by whack by whack 	11.645088761979743

 the porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace 	15.353791374257598

 —now my miss he said 	30.249773119237037

 she tendered a coin smiling boldly holding her thick wrist out 	12.130167820223063

 —thank you my miss 	56.89857116983859

 and one shilling threepence change 	27.764636940872727

 for you please 	149.18866822225334

 mr bloom pointed quickly 	58.518677668228165

 to catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly behind her moving ha <title> pleasant to see first thing in the morning 	16.176849009600048

 she stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right 	17.60734440278664

 sodachapped hands 	1034.5287807429302

 crusted toenails too 	119.60063835804785

 brown scapulars in tatters defending her both ways 	9.354677820213007

 the sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast 	8.582061548554993

 for another a constable off duty cuddling her in eccles’ lane 	13.433072910823556

 they like them sizeable 	70.6729108143906

 o please mr policeman i’m lost in the wood 	30.46033877621729

 —threepence please 	148.5295831691215

 then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles 	18.559122325945914

 they lay were read quickly and quickly slid disc by disc into the till 	13.294529339345317

 —thank you sir 	44.036852146544575

 another time 	364.89518983718017

 a speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him 	10.425219507015461

 he withdrew his gaze after an instant 	25.611916666640912

 no better not another time 	57.51831373759923

 —good morning he said moving away 	45.94938903893921

 no sign 	591.168716564431

 he walked back along dorset street reading gravely 	16.964149590289132

 agendath netaim planters’ company 	32.85303820427031

 nothing doing 	339.80056992114214

 still an idea behind it 	44.30805987905376

 he looked at the cattle blurred in silver heat 	27.24105069254973

 silverpowdered olivetrees 	1034.7784713549374

 quiet long days pruning ripening 	26.32143763929008

 folding the page into his pocket he turned into eccles street hurrying homeward 	21.82244165582449

 cold oils slid along his veins chilling his blood age crusting him with a salt cloak 	11.58005684778491

 runs she runs to meet me a girl with gold hair on the wind 	31.10552929056568

 two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor 	55.72885844947988

 he stooped and gathered them 	31.651002617365954

 mrs marion bloom 	75.71521863803032

 his quickened heart slowed at once 	15.08065523410578

 mrs marion 	230.8604576543789

 —poldy entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head 	11.21168180875769

 —who are the letters for 	61.04697563251652

 he looked at them 	46.03609618082293

 —a letter for me from milly he said carefully and a card to you 	33.460314218344806

 and a letter for you 	54.335569262862904

 he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees 	19.44694122750465

 —do you want the blind up 	28.637268857370227

 letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow 	12.570213810710529

 —that do 	137.7091430326435

 he asked turning 	117.37401302208791

 she was reading the card propped on her elbow 	35.37785627894068

 —she got the things she said 	40.36025749069936

 he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh 	20.879580746577563

 —hurry up with that tea she said 	35.048282599670664

 i’m parched 	51.385948946846135

 —the kettle is boiling he said 	20.85178565073926

 but he delayed to clear the chair her striped petticoat tossed soiled linen and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed 	13.35950197574155

 as he went down the kitchen stairs she called —poldy —what 	20.85133281666827

 —scald the teapot 	52.07375505541316

 on the boil sure enough a plume of steam from the spout 	18.24231596237803

 he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in 	13.946552194818807

 having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt 	15.014806212963698

 while he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him 	12.639648086222746

 give her too much meat she won’t mouse 	26.947615572579725

 say they won’t eat pork 	36.93287201236381

 he let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce 	14.40771842197875

 he sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup 	24.6828928882376

 then he slit open his letter glancing down the page and over 	18.44437678396513

 thanks new tam mr coghlan lough owel picnic young student blazes boylan’s seaside girls 	12.406182978999732

 the tea was drawn 	54.4020355650343

 he filled his own moustachecup sham crown derby smiling 	21.58498373244252

 silly milly’s birthday gift 	68.00746484144668

 i gave her the amberoid necklace she broke 	17.559259203422233

 putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her 	21.972108691949984

 he smiled pouring 	127.02124239445983

 o milly bloom you are my darling 	42.040263928309585

 you are my lookingglass from night to morning 	15.26663856268225

 i’d rather have you without a farthing than katey keogh with her ass and garden 	15.30802560900867

 poor old professor goodwin 	63.490954753745164

 dreadful old case 	129.5825638349386

 still he was a courteous old chap 	41.694521954958034

 oldfashioned way he used to bow molly off the platform 	31.69029052827418

 and the little mirror in his silk hat 	38.28387865348187

 the night milly brought it into the parlour 	34.92286946317601

 o look what i found in professor goodwin’s hat all we laughed 	25.007806637750825

 sex breaking out even then 	29.65109347215512

 pert little piece she was 	39.1735596708312

 he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray 	15.47223475716741

 its hump bumped as he took it up 	20.022465974354038

 everything on it 	116.19894035156818

 bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream 	16.293138540098145

 he carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle 	23.339876358980465

 nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead 	27.655183254000246

 —what a time you were she said 	38.581036736060966

 he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder 	14.758747595180562

 the warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured 	27.163448063483482

 a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow 	14.353399550856928

 in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread 	12.577515368096687

 —who was the letter from 	73.86278951608986

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 —o boylan she said 	36.07063929329875

 he’s bringing the programme 	33.09109908000499

 —what are you singing 	67.29118280421326

 — là ci darem with <initial> <initial> doyle she said and love’s old sweet song  	20.108558965099686

 her full lips drinking smiled 	31.866536549525403

 rather stale smell that incense leaves next day 	14.924977166915333

 —would you like the window open a little 	39.872422365648376

 she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking —what time is the funeral 	21.66189723845426

 —eleven i think he answered 	47.830033375399225

 i didn’t see the paper 	30.52554970376729

 following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed 	26.901720501609514

 then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole 	11.204530909463292

 —no that book 	80.08747138380507

 other stocking 	295.4821239328348

 her petticoat 	300.5005734072656

 —it must have fell down she said 	28.186330320480664

 he felt here and there 	37.5978537615873

 voglio e non vorrei  	48.060475148953735

 not in the bed 	106.68985933089225

 must have slid down 	66.2110283078757

 he stooped and lifted the valance 	33.12082213186194

 —show here she said 	38.33428055972824

 i put a mark in it 	36.32951320116299

 there’s a word i wanted to ask you 	28.789198049643662

 she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word 	12.70987982467278

 —met him what 	101.70333170096585

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 —here she said 	64.01136457008593

 what does that mean 	52.532461451482234

 he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail 	21.202455962859258

 who’s he when he’s at home 	25.154016936828274

 —metempsychosis he said frowning 	75.72543454262674

 it’s greek from the greek 	40.8894114749458

 —o rocks she said 	41.91062362908424

 tell us in plain words 	50.32908635251268

 he smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes 	21.284745879245346

 the same young eyes 	59.303418969618285

 the first night after the charades 	54.79775238110112

 —did you finish it 	44.35839381617177

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 —yes she said 	66.04500863076765

 there’s nothing smutty in it 	23.046525496661186

 —some people believe he said that we go on living in another body after death that we lived before 	19.12206922737426

 they call it reincarnation 	86.30795904986263

 that we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet 	23.725574918570285

 they say we have forgotten it 	52.90141810136584

 some say they remember their past lives 	23.658648231570186

 the sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea 	10.792441264756283

 better remind her of the word metempsychosis 	55.992533787534384

 he turned the pages back 	41.49373262715285

 —metempsychosis he said is what the ancient greeks called it 	26.84251818708738

 what they called nymphs for example 	35.06278797988515

 her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar 	24.994873672595155

 she gazed straight before her inhaling through her arched nostrils 	14.894432950052758

 —there’s a smell of burn she said 	20.568398860406685

 did you leave anything on the fire 	43.393028375404455

 —the kidney he cried suddenly 	41.756592535179976

 he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs 	14.188699370163993

 pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan 	29.724709421095245

 by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back 	17.43552155527386

 only a little burnt 	140.8861654436061

 he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it 	16.67709535300659

 cup of tea now 	64.01550067246977

 he sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf 	22.41007362577271

 he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat 	24.2768792187446

 then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat 	12.094213410285485

 done to a turn 	123.08875780484388

 then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth 	19.257152970049397

 what was that about some young student and a picnic 	34.61759073644

 leaving the door ajar amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces 	9.775602017353755

 before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows 	19.45495772762914

 the king was in his countinghouse 	76.6916572661713

 day then the night 	67.90758873143221

 he tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it 	12.997231831171376

 then he girded up his trousers braced and buttoned himself 	17.5658067701294

 he pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air 	20.39690112333079

 in the bright light lightened and cooled in limb he eyed carefully his black trousers the ends the knees the houghs of the knees 	10.025495121557332

 and past the sailors’ home 	26.396585120329128

 he turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through lime street 	27.11754482738487

 by brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled his bucket of offal linked smoking a chewed fagbutt 	12.889770691633592

 a smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him listlessly holding her battered caskhoop 	9.26608938044751

 couldn’t ask him at a funeral though 	38.3023916137584

 while his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair 	13.885484023459552

 very warm morning 	86.80095501364548

 under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha 	15.95182876924416

 just there 	549.8396568976918

 his right hand came down into the bowl of his hat 	30.293489733688247

 his fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket 	17.292029464788

 so warm 	480.3891392407048

 his right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair 	19.73909646890239

 then he put on his hat again relieved and read again choice blend made of the finest ceylon brands 	18.920762228032604

 the far east 	75.11458417353039

 lovely spot it must be the garden of the world big lazy leaves to float about on cactuses flowery meads snaky lianas they call them 	9.401901006562431

 where was the chap i saw in that picture somewhere 	43.53697815156061

 ah yes in the dead sea floating on his back reading a book with a parasol open 	28.12002423047268

 couldn’t sink if you tried so thick with salt 	20.188788971538887

 because the weight of the water no the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what 	30.531371673425767

 or is it the volume is equal to the weight 	25.559871045742895

 it’s a law something like that 	18.561643442700845

 vance in high school cracking his fingerjoints teaching 	23.912425112966872

 the college curriculum 	129.72885590766518

 law of falling bodies per second per second 	16.613924831959515

 they all fall to the ground 	54.73127782048812

 the earth 	180.24268873516928

 it’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight 	26.75420479196693

 he turned away and sauntered across the road 	23.833919303224338

 how did she walk with her sausages 	48.95430907657872

 like that something 	126.12439731483302

 as he walked he took the folded freeman from his sidepocket unfolded it rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg 	13.268919880648724

 careless air just drop in to see 	32.10026101488271

 per second per second 	39.18344601361365

 per second for every second it means 	30.516306566140482

 from the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice 	21.161422056296818

 too late box 	86.02211884502634

 post here 	622.1389492640368

 he handed the card through the brass grill 	39.97358367816454

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 while the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils smelling freshprinted rag paper 	11.379939294674566

 no answer probably 	148.53914632668287

 went too far last time 	25.174711640764023

 the postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter 	21.981559519935505

 he thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope 	30.258878696340382

 henry flower esq c/o <initial> <initial> westland row city 	17.818439504730524

 he slipped card and letter into his sidepocket reviewing again the soldiers on parade 	14.183760176189809

 where’s old tweedy’s regiment 	50.82271181280116

 that must be why the women go after them 	34.49782401245867

 easier to enlist and drill 	29.083429990426666

 never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby 	30.655424457672883

 he strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right 	29.828444863335495

 talk as if that would mend matters 	46.50023999591156

 his hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope ripping it open in jerks 	21.03180504039161

 women will pay a lot of heed i don’t think 	15.356661211359718

 his fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket 	16.53549055785527

 mr bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the grosvenor 	27.45482419970362

 the porter hoisted the valise up on the well 	24.683875676993207

 she stood still waiting while the man husband brother like her searched his pockets for change 	15.718188178894447

 stylish kind of coat with that roll collar warm for a day like this looks like blanketcloth 	22.393748479560912

 careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets 	40.770457364482596

 like that haughty creature at the polo match 	31.482112593253763

 women all for caste till you touch the spot 	23.882641626455598

 proud rich silk stockings 	44.16654663696412

 —yes mr bloom said 	25.260197322325688

 he moved a little to the side of m’coy’s talking head 	30.573539846561676

 getting up in a minute 	82.34076844835973

 he died on monday poor fellow  	34.41215449839706

 watch watch silk flash rich stockings white 	15.344722737582563

 —one of the best m’coy said 	32.33309579157847

 the tram passed 	118.33176667485354

 they drove off towards the loop line bridge her rich gloved hand on the steel grip 	16.378864051187676

 —o yes mr bloom said 	29.749469065033303

 tiptop thanks 	863.0046795464365

 he unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly what is home without plumtree’s potted meat 	12.626468885553948

 with it an abode of bliss 	16.631709405989895

 —my missus has just got an engagement 	18.58242800303075

 there’s a committee formed 	32.95868357820467

 part shares and part profits 	20.430099635773573

 m’coy nodded picking at his moustache stubble 	20.08950856345267

 —o well he said 	62.56743833557808

 bob cowley lent him his for the wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this 	18.33630003066573

 mr bloom strolling towards brunswick street smiled 	19.783663813105154

 my missus has just got an 	18.222741900716517

 reedy freckled soprano 	140.84944580735802

 cheeseparing nose 	1034.6731376242458

 nice enough in its way for a little ballad 	55.116312376111615

 no guts in it 	58.80492181327747

 you and me don’t you know in the same boat 	28.115743907905923

 give you the needle that would 	34.2660438819343

 can’t he hear the difference 	30.184656223608023

 think he’s that way inclined a bit 	33.164342136862125

 against my grain somehow 	46.104344568956115

 thought that belfast would fetch him 	21.63222328701359

 i hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse 	20.306077062051855

 suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again 	16.57750906165161

 your wife and my wife 	72.49064875251031

 wonder is he pimping after me 	34.05400617224486

 mr bloom stood at the corner his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings 	27.11089418040774

 cantrell and cochrane’s ginger ale aromatic  	26.945120427070496

 hamlet she played last night 	28.232419955872615

 male impersonator 	267.26468362983087

 perhaps he was a woman 	93.81513851357278

 why ophelia committed suicide 	50.65777514613156

 poor papa how he used to talk of kate bateman in that 	17.51989944426074

 year before i was born that was sixtyfive 	55.82091430991401

 and ristori in vienna 	32.57466858095758

 what is this the right name is 	37.774856303219494

 by mosenthal it is 	31.206327279040163

 rachel is it 	143.0233448603004

 the scene he was always talking about where the old blind abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face 	21.213242227220242

 nathan’s voice his son’s voice i hear the voice of nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms who left the house of his father and left the god of his father 	20.308732389013763

 every word is so deep leopold 	34.91514708503131

 poor papa poor man i’m glad i didn’t go into the room to look at his face 	21.783535541818473

 that day o dear o dear ffoo well perhaps it was best for him 	17.16982000178754

 mr bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard 	25.5129350795285

 no use thinking of it any more 	43.69780175095838

 nosebag time 	1034.165608449519

 wish i hadn’t met that m’coy fellow 	20.323264399324422

 he came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth 	9.762666190898026

 their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss 	14.291467973386304

 their eldorado 	327.8050337571859

 poor jugginses damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags 	15.45835960697865

 too full for words 	35.060883803058196

 still they get their feed all right and their doss 	34.05398123362528

 gelded too a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches 	14.733309750233566

 might be happy all the same that way 	32.63160005240302

 good poor brutes they look 	32.4301217083985

 still their neigh can be very irritating 	24.924171515353468

 might just walk into her here 	33.3103039656409

 he passed the cabman’s shelter 	37.70710404954617

 curious the life of drifting cabbies 	39.385590629471906

 all weathers all places time or setdown no will of their own 	10.196341246459038

 voglio e non  	86.03352614395806

 like to give them an odd cigarette 	36.77616370057759

 shout a few flying syllables as they pass 	30.300578011938967

 he hummed là ci darem la mano la la lala la la 	8.698757408772522

 he turned into cumberland street and going on some paces halted in the lee of the station wall 	23.774859601970903

 no one 	164.9297743137565

 meade’s timberyard 	263.4960377503577

 piled balks 	804.1616812983963

 ruins and tenements 	124.0869015642158

 with careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone 	13.993818427821237

 not a sinner 	140.74800694781547

 near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles alone shooting the taw with a cunnythumb 	11.573705468435442

 a wise tabby a blinking sphinx watched from her warm sill 	12.987450749034158

 pity to disturb them 	53.869728130619066

 mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her 	31.949574001029273

 open it 	348.76768740956294

 and once i played marbles when i went to that old dame’s school 	25.47063589883097

 she liked mignonette 	143.38094652767862

 mrs ellis’ <initial> and mr 	54.93430525346158

 he opened the letter within the newspaper 	41.369714475026214

 a flower 	322.4584193557329

 i think it’s <initial> a yellow flower with flattened petals 	18.98169288329499

 not annoyed then 	85.30631496005725

 what does she say 	79.31760053161732

 dear henry i got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it 	21.378234709025516

 why did you enclose the stamps 	33.55167400892385

 i do wish i could punish you for that 	26.364070075033688

 dear henry when will we meet 	26.250618473141166

 i think of you so often you have no idea 	34.51843338068572

 please write me a long letter and tell me more 	31.461069508108963

 i want to know 	43.34862323680095

 he tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket 	13.863832902954757

 language of flowers 	139.10310008578458

 they like it because no one can hear 	39.53693740156493

 then walking slowly forward he read the letter again murmuring here and there a word 	16.37418247349569

 angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how i long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife martha’s perfume 	8.360170223050336

 having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket 	33.864133281840765

 weak joy opened his lips 	36.761884648193

 changed since the first letter 	76.61671859734119

 wonder did she wrote it herself 	58.768826133474825

 doing the indignant a girl of good family like me respectable character 	17.182027175375342

 could meet one sunday after the rosary 	22.96817429049531

 thank you not having any 	54.907375857985265

 usual love scrimmage 	86.11815373872307

 then running round corners 	67.43056956669402

 bad as a row with molly 	62.5397367407328

 cigar has a cooling effect 	52.492623139761655

 go further next time 	38.21582121993572

 brutal why not 	130.9818483806329

 try it anyhow 	96.64670921446209

 a bit at a time 	52.55458176183996

 fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it 	28.972348762755807

 common pin eh 	72.05644485913979

 he threw it on the road 	54.99170384901505

 out of her clothes somewhere pinned together 	25.17763128028471

 queer the number of pins they always have 	25.72315327474623

 no roses without thorns 	51.694033657963644

 flat dublin voices bawled in his head 	23.229593665212743

 those two sluts that night in the coombe linked together in the rain 	27.33401400470904

 o mairy lost the pin of her drawers 	25.93771993042868

 she didn’t know what to do to keep it up to keep it up 	17.491834374762597

 such a bad headache 	60.61654026749744

 has her roses probably 	47.56688666051846

 he strolled out of the shop the newspaper baton under his armpit the coolwrappered soap in his left hand 	15.935461218134382

 at his armpit bantam lyons’ voice and hand said —hello bloom 	21.04596839095663

 bantam lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly 	24.157849921406576

 —what’s that 	31.451141958913357

 his sharp voice said 	38.338171930753695

 —i say you can keep it mr bloom answered 	36.20300875198898

 i was going to throw it away that moment 	28.608490914835063

 this is my body 	82.42484346089269

 he foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full naked in a womb of warmth oiled by scented melting soap softly laved 	11.628784877261202

 he saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained buoyed lightly upward lemonyellow his navel bud of flesh and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands a languid floating flower 	10.3360311557999

 <number> martin cunningham first poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and entering deftly seated himself 	11.18400267486552

 mr power stepped in after him curving his height with care 	15.639053985710149

 —come on simon 	66.39495838157399

 mr bloom entered and sat in the vacant place 	37.7510188715574

 he pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight 	18.052715314574368

 stowing in the wreaths probably 	134.67334625794535

 all waited 	340.1114980100394

 then wheels were heard from in front turning then nearer then horses’ hoofs 	11.738239803208506

 their carriage began to move creaking and swaying 	21.661715434711063

 other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind 	14.742829647451325

 the blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker door ajar 	14.182488224564088

 at walking pace 	75.72362376857606

 they waited still their knees jogging till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks 	18.127832019800973

 tritonville road 	662.7631731588459

 the wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes 	19.433675801236287

 —what way is he taking us 	44.32490834505857

 —irishtown martin cunningham said 	30.991515409557433

 brunswick street 	490.98048113091033

 mr dedalus nodded looking out 	32.945340331348085

 —that’s a fine old custom he said 	17.749847004792358

 i am glad to see it has not died out 	29.599831812396044

 all watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers 	11.292402851724027

 mr bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man clad in mourning a wide hat 	15.197613303432945

 —there’s a friend of yours gone by dedalus he said 	15.691723665241888

 —your son and heir 	45.384085876597645

 —where is he 	51.87834475277961

 mr dedalus said stretching over across 	20.90854562000693

 the carriage passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses lurched round the corner and swerving back to the tramtrack rolled on noisily with chattering wheels 	8.635181365718447

 he was alone 	159.9595506449615

 —down with his aunt sally i suppose mr dedalus said the goulding faction the drunken little costdrawer and crissie papa’s little lump of dung the wise child that knows her own father 	11.774080933318956

 about six hundred per cent profit 	23.466638234675603

 —he’s in with a lowdown crowd mr dedalus snarled 	27.137314322598517

 that mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts 	15.440392692549333

 his name stinks all over dublin 	40.31674676208257

 but with the help of god and his blessed mother i’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate 	20.52795678332486

 i’ll tickle his catastrophe believe you me 	13.24023601485634

 he cried above the clatter of the wheels —i won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son 	20.10054784408095

 he ceased 	430.07977266366134

 mr bloom glanced from his angry moustache to mr power’s mild face and martin cunningham’s eyes and beard gravely shaking 	19.506902417685225

 the carriage heeled over and back their four trunks swaying 	15.031721661890854

 —corny might have given us a more commodious yoke mr power said 	17.727155053753503

 —he might mr dedalus said if he hadn’t that squint troubling him 	21.793547024730554

 he closed his left eye 	53.12639074262374

 —what is this he said in the name of god 	33.063420272218124

 —someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately mr power said 	16.439696869317427

 mr dedalus twisting his nose frowned downward and said —unless i’m greatly mistaken 	17.74626523620978

 what do you think martin 	51.65132408254427

 —it struck me too martin cunningham said 	21.85350119438689

 mr dedalus sighed resignedly 	54.854664813693056

 —after all he said it’s the most natural thing in the world 	32.44320626570836

 —did tom kernan turn up 	34.312916694478766

 mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly —the devil break the hasp of your back mr power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray’s statue 	16.957854957497467

 —we have all been there martin cunningham said broadly 	26.295709474835423

 martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly coughed and put it back 	15.336257787919854

 —the greatest disgrace to have in the family mr power added 	36.00101232928102

 —they say a man who does it is a coward mr dedalus said 	28.408824936707646

 mr bloom about to speak closed his lips again 	39.316615423133946

 martin cunningham’s large eyes 	44.291492383174834

 looking away now 	116.55019343031387

 yet sometimes they repent too late 	24.402437614049884

 found in the riverbed clutching rushes 	46.053578948116346

 setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every saturday almost 	18.066055985004933

 —we are going the pace i think martin cunningham said 	20.883199764374137

 from one extreme to the other 	37.30907505964233

 the carriage galloped round a corner stopped 	25.76430161516151

 a divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows lowing slouching by on padded hoofs whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups 	7.782169848628314

 outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear 	14.529172113124641

 —emigrants mr power said 	33.69595027697299

 the carriage moved on through the drove 	28.12449454363716

 —i can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays mr bloom said 	18.629464848811903

 all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats 	22.98715816702563

 —instead of blocking up the thoroughfare martin cunningham said 	21.12626576438527

 they ought to 	55.80439946429504

 —yes mr bloom said and another thing i often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in milan you know 	16.216679066142703

 run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all 	17.845135973432647

 wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast 	16.607605417669152

 —well there’s something in that mr dedalus granted 	48.84092748852441

 —and martin cunningham said we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road 	14.772985362964686

 that’s the maxim of the law 	27.362326697915687

 he glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum 	23.37342978799577

 —was he insured 	91.13568989256552

 —i believe so mr kernan answered 	39.23343210292283

 but the policy was heavily mortgaged 	26.88811635464833

 martin is trying to get the youngster into artane 	24.501773555571823

 —indeed yes mr bloom agreed 	62.37243605064402

 he looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished 	32.44294089942737

 she had outlived him 	53.12221893021817

 lost her husband 	69.718715169299

 more dead for her than for me 	38.13183657219683

 one must outlive the other 	26.10461435743948

 wise men say 	110.80038314065315

 there are more women than men in the world 	22.885317461321154

 all for a shadow 	113.60517695667664

 consort not even a king 	59.71140613766796

 her son was the substance 	79.37398230731581

 something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back waiting 	20.976958075772625

 it never comes 	79.88013688007344

 one must go first alone under the ground and lie no more in her warm bed 	25.465660639561342

 ned lambert said softly clasping hands 	21.49275086800378

 dick tivy bald 	102.31544353317699

 —martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters ned lambert said pointing ahead 	22.67183113168201

 a few bob a skull 	34.29842554755635

 just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up 	18.904593836367027

 —yes yes mr dedalus said dubiously 	40.39554888805293

 —yes ned lambert said with the wife’s brother 	37.98648614679037

 he put down his name for a quid 	64.66268883510801

 —i’ll engage he did mr dedalus said 	18.200291964916772

 i often told poor paddy he ought to mind that job 	19.50482115432193

 john henry is not the worst in the world 	35.251100857410904

 —how did he lose it 	43.463248650954505

 ned lambert asked 	83.73500974042145

 liquor what 	542.0959478045427

 —many a good man’s fault mr dedalus said with a sigh 	39.492858523274435

 they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel 	45.61811711851162

 mr bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar 	17.253278591924392

 poor boy was he there when the father 	44.14753532606468

 both unconscious 	472.08740279148736

 lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time 	33.08781808988033

 all he might have done 	71.04498687373668

 i owe three shillings to o’grady 	37.8461259715376

 would he understand 	124.69023096011423

 the mutes bore the coffin into the chapel 	27.43178485357398

 which end is his head 	33.61451642692927

 after a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light 	29.49528968554243

 the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners 	12.982235918891456

 always in front of us 	49.734245325987004

 corny kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel 	17.144374574010037

 the mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks 	24.35629501765051

 mr bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it 	11.366095513881577

 he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously 	13.573718138805356

 a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door 	21.349303635893964

 the whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly 	16.962600088941176

 who’ll read the book 	47.95935018021097

 i said the rook 	80.10673474479934

 they halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak 	35.0843553471916

 father coffey 	382.0263377090635

 i knew his name was like a coffin 	51.15558958895111

 burst sideways like a sheep in clover dedalus says he will 	23.815781622978065

 with a belly on him like a poisoned pup 	36.14316323580798

 what swells him up that way 	42.153168850607564

 molly gets swelled after cabbage 	34.83068205147158

 air of the place maybe 	87.86853506964727

 looks full up of bad gas 	35.9014715320823

 butchers for instance they get like raw beefsteaks 	31.376646693518556

 who was telling me 	53.57918768535239

 mervyn browne 	579.7288306406106

 down in the vaults of saint werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it 	16.242539354736056

 out it rushes blue 	27.392753526980893

 one whiff of that and you’re a goner 	33.056000244166746

 my kneecap is hurting me 	20.335349462890758

 that’s better 	47.86929031067599

 the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin 	25.992258227515755

 as you were before you rested 	64.17089964867178

 it’s all written down he has to do it 	22.083109848361964

 —et ne nos inducas in tentationem 	15.918131049373113

 the server piped the answers in the treble 	29.080642080339302

 i often thought it would be better to have boy servants 	29.876969192749982

 after that of course  	70.01565241007408

 holy water that was i expect 	50.85040358294209

 shaking sleep out of it 	37.58880013595599

 he must be fed up with that job shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up 	20.55028287002414

 every mortal day a fresh batch middleaged men old women children women dead in childbirth men with beards baldheaded businessmen consumptive girls with little sparrows’ breasts 	6.8429597178718184

 all the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them sleep 	23.918552208025766

 on dignam now 	69.10041600640552

 —in paradisum 	108.05810271758557

 said he was going to paradise or is in paradise 	28.96593004221325

 says that over everybody 	45.987779152304874

 tiresome kind of a job 	93.40465310207222

 but he has to say something 	68.51650079291751

 the priest closed his book and went off followed by the server 	26.151796467103484

 corny kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart 	18.982668158518553

 corny kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother in law 	24.618281595917903

 all followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air 	27.678526986278918

 mr bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket 	15.142411964971487

 he gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left 	24.246942629658164

 the metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres 	12.116029857824712

 the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo 	10.832830226922452

 —the o’connell circle mr dedalus said about him 	23.309469240674307

 mr power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone 	30.89619229187138

 —he’s at rest he said in the middle of his people old dan o’ 	20.92454444386384

 but his heart is buried in rome 	28.834168345766123

 how many broken hearts are buried here simon —her grave is over there jack mr dedalus said 	10.006531808479249

 i’ll soon be stretched beside her 	17.86420674161308

 let him take me whenever he likes 	32.335898326410806

 breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk 	20.25427312827827

 mr power took his arm 	54.69805233323709

 —she’s better where she is he said kindly 	40.09839577066518

 i suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven 	38.408874458935024

 corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by 	14.01018222659432

 —sad occasions mr kernan began politely 	26.56434628883562

 mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head 	18.629692983742235

 —the others are putting on their hats mr kernan said 	24.026862464146152

 i suppose we can do so too 	39.091005309245666

 we are the last 	61.050288319753776

 this cemetery is a treacherous place 	35.675674615324304

 they covered their heads 	50.45745464855999

 —the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly don’t you think 	16.534676424569582

 mr kernan said with reproof 	50.96655799334919

 mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes 	26.743432000329502

 secret eyes secretsearching 	87.99867411582169

 mason i think not sure 	62.04105568577696

 we are the last 	61.050288319753776

 in the same boat 	62.773226301689675

 hope he’ll say something else 	45.58608425644322

 mr kernan added —the service of the irish church used in mount jerome is simpler more impressive i must say 	13.698837902616473

 mr bloom gave prudent assent 	38.34870961614802

 the language of course was another thing 	37.284516214252676

 mr kernan said with solemnity — i am the resurrection and the life  	23.755187061698972

 that touches a man’s inmost heart 	32.2353284288072

 —it does mr bloom said 	37.468352857790954

 your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies 	22.352202076616834

 corny kelleher fell into step at their side 	23.628424335154758

 —everything went off a1 he said 	19.928218712862012

 he looked on them from his drawling eye 	38.12408961103061

 with your tooraloom tooraloom 	55.153907595101266

 —as it should be mr kernan said 	36.757884057621865

 corny kelleher said 	86.21953800441399

 mr kernan assured him 	50.844268066654536

 john henry menton asked 	46.7698229238654

 i know his face 	52.9274597572662

 ned lambert glanced back 	51.65580368377895

 —bloom he said madame marion tweedy that was is i mean the soprano 	28.010715160727614

 she’s his wife 	42.854192874506275

 —o to be sure john henry menton said 	25.89186158457413

 i haven’t seen her for some time 	32.44411451401588

 she was a finelooking woman 	50.53133353620144

 i danced with her wait fifteen seventeen golden years ago at mat dillon’s in roundtown 	14.18250209066882

 he looked behind through the others 	45.210115196050154

 —what is he 	46.509474604769366

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 what does he do 	82.9564596810615

 wasn’t he in the stationery line 	42.80454460048269

 i fell foul of him one evening i remember at bowls 	25.024715134357738

 ned lambert smiled 	120.8547227360443

 —yes he was he said in wisdom hely’ <initial> a traveller for blottingpaper 	22.917834420255343

 —in god’s name john henry menton said what did she marry a coon like that for 	16.663713225572636

 she had plenty of game in her then 	32.75217349332962

 —has still ned lambert said 	27.901453808915566

 he does some canvassing for ads 	26.483473200988364

 john henry menton’s large eyes stared ahead 	22.97487166585633

 the barrow turned into a side lane 	37.09425138022909

 a portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage 	14.976272956209137

 the gravediggers touched their caps 	28.042515564551554

 —john o’connell mr power said pleased 	29.197255645092167

 he never forgets a friend 	35.50049985057229

 mr o’connell shook all their hands in silence 	25.456241247601035

 mr dedalus said —i am come to pay you another visit 	30.26013077831022

 i don’t want your custom at all 	15.739192868944006

 saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back 	15.907720320591524

 —did you hear that one he asked them about mulcahy from the coombe 	30.314548282039638

 —i did not martin cunningham said 	30.24239656393511

 they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear 	11.354671095896292

 the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles 	17.742179321015755

 —they tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs 	20.77691735157044

 after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough 	22.38693684813297

 one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy 	32.095840896527655

 the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up 	15.991824661827591

 the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed 	25.988267415266357

 he resumed —and after blinking up at the sacred figure not a bloody bit like the man says he 	26.544813481125985

 that’s not mulcahy says he whoever done it  	18.441961824377003

 rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked 	12.055311025089468

 —that’s all done with a purpose martin cunningham explained to hynes 	22.75771976797691

 —i know hynes said 	42.66332994926593

 i know that 	77.81780281888535

 —to cheer a fellow up martin cunningham said 	15.179357208364529

 mr bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk 	31.31244027931

 all want to be on good terms with him 	26.043071746417333

 it might thrill her first 	32.58779366095965

 have you ever seen a ghost 	39.232938786880155

 well i have 	129.65502773073428

 it was a pitchdark night 	34.7228636371767

 the clock was on the stroke of twelve 	30.716885998627998

 with thanks 	285.6689209683572

 i daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure bones flesh nails 	13.263215605981165

 turning green and pink decomposing 	39.378430404798166

 rot quick in damp earth 	42.305119261974234

 live for ever practically 	78.49322388707614

 nothing to feed on feed on themselves 	27.011375237665348

 soil must be simply swirling with them 	30.518060781338185

 your head it simply swurls 	27.13823611739744

 those pretty little seaside gurls 	28.905469461892324

 he looks cheerful enough over it 	22.383043075724967

 gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first 	30.169259534848376

 wonder how he looks at life 	54.030310233471674

 cracking his jokes too warms the cockles of his heart 	17.54213866101814

 go out of mourning first 	97.68275220582697

 hard to imagine his funeral 	51.19326997258428

 seems a sort of a joke 	63.138844328292

 read your own obituary notice they say you live longer 	20.10456087474606

 gives you second wind 	48.95074627884392

 new lease of life 	31.448686734124834

 —how many have you for tomorrow 	51.046937145638815

 the caretaker asked 	75.30209687452333

 —two corny kelleher said 	42.946925697035304

 half ten and eleven 	59.06776539740794

 the caretaker put the papers in his pocket 	32.053325974282956

 the barrow had ceased to trundle 	24.187484795549654

 the mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves 	19.45775546507882

 the gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it 	11.888967663995077

 burying him 	700.9031193283367

 we come to bury cæsar 	73.73208550200621

 his ides of march or june 	17.960915122040298

 he doesn’t know who is here nor care 	23.620086659969022

 now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh 	27.005686779906092

 now who is he i’d like to know 	31.862910479163066

 now i’d give a trifle to know who he is 	22.9776296194402

 always someone turns up you never dreamt of 	22.821883318303527

 a fellow could live on his lonesome all his life 	24.6050469036611

 yes he could 	141.1311704043449

 still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave 	22.97397882260113

 we all do 	164.26000603838588

 only man buries 	134.26475107511695

 no ants too 	93.61465046725598

 first thing strikes anybody 	59.25261399203097

 bury the dead 	112.38553079872942

 say robinson crusoe was true to life 	17.019870836982854

 well then friday buried him 	30.981381376798897

 every friday buries a thursday if you come to look at it 	20.046735481767918

 o poor robinson crusoe how could you possibly do so 	17.745049382973637

 poor dignam his last lie on the earth in his box 	38.66427452170855

 when you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood 	22.073667540276862

 all gnawed through 	84.68113886151211

 they could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way 	16.919280051495544

 ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’ <initial> they’re so particular 	28.945914445474827

 bit of clay from the holy land 	69.34372591618944

 only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin 	23.393159367881434

 i see what it means 	65.35217366735009

 i see 	144.63460020513716

 to protect him as long as possible even in the earth 	25.83004205402782

 the irishman’s house is his coffin 	37.888562186282535

 embalming in catacombs mummies the same idea 	29.099189994820826

 mr bloom stood far back his hat in his hand counting the bared heads 	21.763104835280284

 i’m thirteen 	51.34968353888717

 the chap in the macintosh is thirteen 	37.09295098204436

 death’s number 	163.8171503777148

 where the deuce did he pop out of 	23.424008158472084

 he wasn’t in the chapel that i’ll swear 	37.78345412735757

 silly superstition that about thirteen 	39.90738828535362

 nice soft tweed ned lambert has in that suit 	28.887245007590213

 tinge of purple 	164.77516575644393

 i had one like that when we lived in lombard street west 	24.11246514756946

 dressy fellow he was once 	101.73032542800847

 used to change three suits in the day 	34.74470916289474

 must get that grey suit of mine turned by mesias 	19.737096386648577

 it’s dyed 	74.37568855472249

 his wife i forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him 	14.758789208612109

 the coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles 	24.93176249921188

 they struggled up and out and all uncovered 	61.24291458789758

 if we were all suddenly somebody else 	33.868510829318275

 far away a donkey brayed 	38.190569192621155

 no such ass 	151.68791295401354

 never see a dead one they say 	35.7108674299603

 shame of death 	109.55880717694357

 they hide 	488.7342083483748

 also poor papa went away 	47.75385500262852

 gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper 	23.133239551654906

 the boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space 	19.053176943973643

 mr bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker 	22.54119942244668

 wellcut frockcoat 	1034.7699755066403

 well it is a long rest 	90.13693838265097

 feel no more 	93.95126307538588

 must be damned unpleasant 	83.3441480046068

 can’t believe it at first 	36.10071619948044

 mistake must be someone else 	65.24018388862135

 try the house opposite 	104.544439625895

 wait i wanted to 	46.12340717268946

 i haven’t yet 	67.13118749061016

 then darkened deathchamber 	113.48535516835238

 light they want 	81.15736626542108

 whispering around you 	136.7592397762152

 would you like to see a priest 	36.83198577145646

 then rambling and wandering 	48.04207464885463

 his sleep is not natural 	56.1479330329522

 press his lower eyelid 	51.32988109432474

 watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow 	22.284985345394876

 pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed 	26.357639521682533

 devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman 	32.08959421588211

 dying to embrace her in his shirt 	46.86099424983173

 last act of lucia 	76.90950661716447

 shall i nevermore behold thee  	26.82103300128507

 bam he expires 	165.47365165363922

 gone at last 	82.5577870716999

 people talk about you a bit forget you 	42.60555307317246

 don’t forget to pray for him 	19.87192156400205

 remember him in your prayers 	133.6947480596953

 even parnell 	504.01498451131187

 ivy day dying out 	56.22840147631072

 then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other 	24.03418362131012

 we are praying now for the repose of his soul 	29.865728516688986

 hoping you’re well and not in hell 	42.2044920394968

 nice change of air 	86.92377544315096

 out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory 	30.65140424684228

 they say you do when you shiver in the sun 	36.823522999918836

 someone walking over it 	46.218519690496564

 callboy’s warning 	298.14763014570383

 near you 	424.7895824754986

 mine over there towards finglas the plot i bought 	15.12299494053983

 mamma poor mamma and little rudy 	34.64026533151261

 the gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin 	16.01386948304381

 mr bloom turned away his face 	30.85045288890055

 and if he was alive all the time 	36.51592397305458

 whew by jingo that would be awful no no he is dead of course 	26.17787262024058

 of course he is dead 	35.830768559907426

 monday he died 	100.50285569618497

 they ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole 	17.613935662199253

 flag of distress 	111.15733152694435

 three days 	435.48942433452686

 rather long to keep them in summer 	40.650743549206304

 just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no 	25.99323120361828

 the clay fell softer 	48.7242791594012

 begin to be forgotten 	197.06129581363945

 out of sight out of mind 	57.38555697450596

 had enough of it 	51.32405330065829

 the mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show 	12.512677190173957

 mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves 	17.88153691905241

 quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields 	18.686395642491973

 hynes jotting down something in his notebook 	43.78152744148563

 ah the names 	125.79735344973062

 but he knows them all 	49.57111542311365

 —charley hynes said writing 	52.58337130322726

 he was on the freeman once 	65.08937279321613

 so he was before he got the job in the morgue under louis byrne 	29.620500868697523

 good idea a postmortem for doctors 	19.12266774223444

 he died of a tuesday 	110.96401690241763

 —and tell us hynes said do you know that fellow in the fellow was over there in the 	23.84794313589103

 where is he now 	66.21170883376368

 —m’intosh hynes said scribbling 	32.48117643607147

 i don’t know who he is 	19.34534182590409

 he moved away looking about him 	25.97473104190978

 —no mr bloom began turning and stopping 	25.828406293262574

 i say hynes didn’t hear 	28.8897157004309

 where has he disappeared to 	38.64489199519004

 not a sign 	111.15937489684286

 become invisible 	446.44385310379965

 good lord what became of him 	27.415046926565783

 a seventh gravedigger came beside mr bloom to take up an idle spade 	14.664285037518114

 —o excuse me he stepped aside nimbly 	32.64396727740531

 clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole 	34.80297001237285

 it rose 	438.5995739293311

 nearly over 	621.7939546114499

 a mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades 	12.388183797635321

 all uncovered again for a few instants 	43.65850588970785

 the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brother in law his on a lump 	16.05113099121403

 the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow 	16.636856762395357

 then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean 	25.876307911944473

 one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass 	18.918624667410278

 one leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing 	10.205261659202556

 silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband 	26.197591801358463

 his navelcord 	368.3242359247583

 the brother in law turning away placed something in his free hand 	17.02600652135757

 thanks in silence 	118.88104750041369

 sorry sir trouble 	116.2396182623584

 i know that 	77.81780281888535

 for yourselves just 	65.36434642321929

 the mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb 	11.260168200610188

 —let us go round by the chief’s grave hynes said 	30.99767460359017

 we have time 	150.07641188546782

 —let us mr power said 	35.13436247736412

 they turned to the right following their slow thoughts 	29.026054175076577

 —like that mr bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top 	24.578509054474168

 mr bloom glancing sideways up from the cross he had made saw the foreman’s sallow face think he has a touch of jaundice and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper 	12.651234990826701

 —we can do that he said 	34.110567690901

 let him give us a three months’ renewal 	24.91205289609052

 a typesetter brought him a limp galleypage 	36.64271296027224

 he began to check it silently 	30.173876113666893

 erin green gem of the silver sea —the ghost walks professor machugh murmured softly biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane 	18.347419956647638

 mr dedalus staring from the empty fireplace at ned lambert’s quizzing face asked of it sourly —agonising christ wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse 	14.794103718261178

 ned lambert seated on the table read on — or again note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles to the tumbling waters of neptune’s blue domain ’mid mossy banks fanned by gentlest zephyrs played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest  	10.412511359172473

 what about that simon 	93.3535726776316

 he asked over the fringe of his newspaper 	55.765002160172536

 how’s that for high 	58.44727640545909

 —changing his drink mr dedalus said 	22.811854868333313

 ned lambert laughing struck the newspaper on his knees repeating — the pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage  	20.224600195704994

 o boys o boys —and xenophon looked upon marathon mr dedalus said looking again on the fireplace and to the window and marathon looked on the sea 	17.010854021838142

 —that will do professor machugh cried from the window 	26.6374418922162

 i don’t want to hear any more of the stuff 	29.67037272214266

 he ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and hungered made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand 	13.411265475501361

 high falutin stuff 	76.24901076596345

 —a recently discovered fragment of cicero professor machugh answered with pomp of tone 	11.382150427381802

 our lovely land  	97.1527537018378

 short but to the point —whose land 	43.756145214569415

 mr bloom said simply 	57.71664719932931

 —most pertinent question the professor said between his chews 	20.159224099474393

 with an accent on the whose 	64.20239061846287

 —dan dawson’s land mr dedalus said 	28.912458360209907

 ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside chuckling with delight 	16.131861217608193

 an instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor machugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face 	15.991372916399246

 —doughy daw he cried 	30.833813528028013

 the inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face crested by a comb of feathery hair thrust itself in 	10.202590444472138

 the bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked —what is it 	19.206786758715552

 —and here comes the sham squire himself professor machugh said grandly 	13.52794516395112

 the editor said 	51.41110013357076

 well yes bushe yes 	49.17394933867502

 he has a strain of it in his blood 	41.40679570666083

 kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe 	33.165969493261805

 —he would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for  	25.79287207479636

 but no matter 	131.54047914145042

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly —one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe 	15.186032792568405

 it was in that case of fratricide the childs murder case 	19.19045644691537

 bushe defended him 	82.54590410669913

 and in the porches of mine ear did pour 	21.408568209225233

 by the way how did he find that out 	29.911084695905924

 he died in his sleep 	95.54224745071723

 or the other story beast with two backs 	27.682885012400007

 —what was that 	58.50318880390761

 the professor asked 	90.5658854781979

 italia magistra artium —he spoke on the law of evidence <initial> <initial> o’molloy said of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code the lex talionis  	13.056714855749629

 and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican 	23.119670295517903

 —a few wellchosen words lenehan prefaced 	24.992400566810318

 silence pause 	487.9011407043733

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy took out his cigarettecase 	20.499342515584754

 false lull 	294.2483441376478

 something quite ordinary 	104.2807253654037

 messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar 	19.468001250762644

 i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives 	11.516975883644681

 a polished period <initial> <initial> o’molloy resumed moulding his words —he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live 	9.840231652689926

 his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall 	19.09254590693798

 —fine myles crawford said at once 	30.386056148461282

 —the divine afflatus mr o’madden burke said 	14.514058346684354

 —you like it 	86.03459966025173

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy asked stephen 	18.867094191847677

 stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed 	14.113895613245774

 he took a cigarette from the case 	39.43031772474668

 <initial> <initial> o’molloy offered his case to myles crawford 	11.865413142518893

 lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy saying —muchibus thankibus 	14.156949850145761

 a man of high morale —professor magennis was speaking to me about you <initial> <initial> o’molloy said to stephen 	13.284965275838541

 what do you think really of that hermetic crowd the opal hush poets <initial> <initial> the mastermystic 	13.692185314053683

 that blavatsky woman started it 	22.10414232519492

 she was a nice old bag of tricks 	33.98214537330641

 <initial> <initial> has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness 	19.069252103120373

 magennis thinks you must have been pulling <initial> <initial> ’s leg 	35.62513772854964

 he is a man of the very highest morale magennis 	35.64825509180124

 speaking about me 	95.40731296918796

 what did he say 	57.871033650274946

 what did he say 	57.871033650274946

 what did he say about me 	33.175899181354076

 don’t ask 	46.87970694300723

 —no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside 	14.135906740573944

 let me say one thing 	34.26423441993239

 the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society 	15.471105530534926

 mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue 	12.77897065738722

 he turned towards myles crawford and said —you know gerald fitzgibbon 	24.58269790524816

 then you can imagine the style of his discourse 	42.71324811190309

 —he is sitting with tim healy <initial> <initial> o’molloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission 	14.508863599158715

 —he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a child’s frock 	33.492045516818195

 go on 	212.37346477426024

 —it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement 	13.474389504886542

 it was then a new movement 	57.90249535730021

 we were weak therefore worthless 	37.6065419643834

 he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus 	12.674144257835176

 impromptu in ferial tone he addressed <initial> <initial> o’molloy —taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed 	15.181533730045976

 that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall 	20.86789831137419

 he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man 	17.09760831477575

 his gaze turned at once but slowly from <initial> <initial> o’molloy’s towards stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground seeking 	19.476685079081705

 his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair 	12.111924611404005

 still seeking he said —when fitzgibbon’s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply 	17.277636940849007

 briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these 	25.757920835171074

 he raised his head firmly 	81.95542138336897

 his eyes bethought themselves once more 	19.748421711154425

 witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet 	19.73820195325099

 he began —mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend 	14.189857558347517

 it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses 	20.254027275631945

 his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech 	9.57293331802994

 and let our crooked smokes 	29.968119969767297

 noble words coming 	98.66947602843521

 look out 	370.6650766673138

 could you try your hand at it yourself 	39.80539338685068

 —and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride 	19.016562449552236

 i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me 	18.466619097543802

 from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted 	13.40060128436967

 ah curse you that’s saint augustine 	41.969197107774534

 —why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language 	14.462392748179083

 you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people 	16.530516749541253

 you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe 	8.612742210514364

 you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity 	11.52065650245046

 child man effigy 	55.435452989934035

 by the nilebank the babemaries kneel cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned stonebearded heart of stone 	9.050982143465726

 —you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples majestic and mysterious are the abodes of isis and osiris of horus and ammon ra 	7.094617540608701

 yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas 	15.760065482089635

 israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her ar <title> vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name 	10.593619095360559

 a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech 	11.68877718229458

 he lifted his voice above it boldly —but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day 	12.426877403393027

 he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw 	17.95533264230353

 he ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence 	21.80606270418604

 ominous—for him <initial> <initial> o’molloy said not without regret —and yet he died without having entered the land of promise 	16.74270874608234

 —a—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously— expectorated—demise lenehan added 	7.435346602980115

 and with a great future behind him 	34.81186269880176

 the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase 	10.900843434491712

 —that is oratory the professor said uncontradicted 	29.62011928617631

 gone with the wind 	149.72475346591872

 miles of ears of porches 	32.61012371414113

 the tribune’s words howled and scattered to the four winds 	27.45613191067418

 a people sheltered within his voice 	21.06455537160188

 dead noise 	407.4893998880786

 love and laud him me no more 	23.483195026481283

 —gentlemen stephen said 	58.046248966012335

 as the next motion on the agenda paper may i suggest that the house do now adjourn 	21.483245370627948

 they caught up on the others and walked abreast 	38.71728877432491

 a blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane 	19.988307463563228

 no tram in sight 	51.87291245575641

 wants to cross 	142.22934350337965

 —do you want to cross 	39.66404242045695

 he moved his head uncertainly 	79.369021996801

 —you’re in dawson street mr bloom said 	16.640665601439924

 molesworth street is opposite 	66.10113124723432

 do you want to cross 	42.11981457339799

 there’s nothing in the way 	43.4295537815545

 the cane moved out trembling to the left 	20.77497787657147

 mr bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before drago’ <initial> where i saw his brillantined hair just when i was 	12.511954779698161

 horse drooping 	286.7325801904286

 driver in john long’ <initial> slaking his drouth 	25.113346291027224

 —there’s a van there mr bloom said but it’s not moving 	22.72228313631835

 i’ll see you across 	31.094997887568507

 do you want to go to molesworth street 	27.50591780484667

 —yes the stripling answered 	29.7774437007319

 south frederick street 	72.58083001255984

 he touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward 	12.723831872827441

 say something to him 	75.72831425400649

 better not do the condescending 	65.17944615229281

 have to be spoonfed first 	56.31000030929981

 like milly’s was 	50.753007976562024

 sizing me up i daresay from my hand 	35.2695604429381

 keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs tired drudge get his doze 	23.004965608682426

 that’s right 	36.552222499674926

 behind a bull in front of a horse 	34.60167732473857

 —thanks sir 	149.72678937891803

 —right now 	145.16340764104717

 first turn to the left 	70.91645895990922

 the blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again 	15.038563858632843

 poor young fellow how on earth did he know that van was there 	19.05297261182244

 must have felt it 	74.49362401476887

 see things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume 	26.963307838753774

 weight or size of it something blacker than the dark 	22.530844690118432

 wonder would he feel it if something was removed 	35.63629149427677

 feel a gap 	149.910290223422

 queer idea of dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones 	28.517867352335653

 could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane 	25.920019819364317

 bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest 	34.4685600397707

 penrose that was that chap’s name 	56.391662093822134

 look at all the things they can learn to do 	33.40505805694755

 read with their fingers 	87.06526923493253

 tune pianos 	543.62784344857

 or we are surprised they have any brains 	37.25398331642176

 why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say 	16.569249030698547

 of course the other senses are more 	20.257007233474212

 plait baskets 	755.8163640540271

 people ought to help 	99.73453404497121

 might take an objection 	56.77947524011576

 dark men they call them 	33.78622591492773

 sense of smell must be stronger too 	29.250323651748595

 smells on all sides bunched together 	30.721606011928216

 each street different smell 	42.60741905141691

 each person too 	92.16555113639816

 then the spring the summer smells 	38.20088867344769

 they say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head 	23.29627724547151

 also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure 	33.83151493383126

 and with a woman for instance 	53.46444202217581

 more shameless not seeing 	32.487615821800695

 that girl passing the stewart institution head in the air 	19.515530976277816

 look at me 	104.33612697931025

 i have them all on 	53.79781338408767

 must be strange not to see her 	37.539307412448245

 kind of a form in his mind’s eye 	46.216678068139835

 the voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves 	19.28998643155354

 his hands on her hair for instance 	45.827495132313075

 say it was black for instance 	52.153961294356705

 we call it black 	102.24695670403509

 then passing over her white skin 	42.65197275406908

 different feel perhaps 	84.81249100001104

 feeling of white 	88.49387356660205

 stationer’s just here too 	72.0919074718873

 think over it 	77.14870285822377

 with a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears 	13.72010517975116

 fibres of fine fine straw 	49.3166833449361

 then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek 	33.30847030522783

 downy hair there too 	71.38820718672046

 not smooth enough 	92.24095406639374

 the belly is the smoothest 	83.3443891619022

 there he goes into frederick street 	24.728740756861793

 perhaps to levenston’s dancing academy piano 	31.047041960810315

 might be settling my braces 	34.217547967081885

 walking by doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly 	15.748032777846497

 but i know it’s whitey yellow 	47.6859157047375

 want to try in the dark to see 	43.52967312559058

 he withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to 	23.137248395935494

 poor fellow quite a boy 	54.69158006924123

 really terrible 	379.9934495654331

 it is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre 	19.207435508152706

 he speaks the words to burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name hamlet i am thy father’s spirit bidding him list 	13.282684281148091

 —the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could 	23.139636722831085

 —bosh stephen said rudely 	80.10464164341293

 his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant 	17.555466956035925

 beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life 	30.18419141960667

 why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him 	12.31390708090174

 he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet  	17.62801592632576

 belief in himself has been untimely killed 	28.66162898625709

 the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator 	14.199658559981904

 he swears his highness not his lordship by saint patrick 	14.34216350374731

 —the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde’s mr best said lifting his brilliant notebook 	22.715774797001504

 that portrait of mr <initial> <initial> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes a man all hues 	20.108431590635675

 —for willie hughes is it not 	31.006843298213017

 the quaker librarian asked 	26.7305091863783

 or hughie wills 	62.49018154248644

 of course it’s all paradox don’t you know hughes and hews and hues the colour but it’s so typical the way he works it out 	10.465904744695477

 it’s the very essence of wilde don’t you know 	14.075266413169345

 the light touch 	151.77232962526134

 a onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes 	10.365046701924877

 he jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend john conmee <initial> <initial> father conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown 	15.351390424451848

 father conmee crossed to mountjoy square 	22.352943183434018

 he thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal wolsey’s words if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have abandoned me in my old days 	14.756470461296551

 he walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of mr david sheehy <initial> <initial> —very well indeed father 	14.81578792622212

 father conmee was wonderfully well indeed 	19.601567930765736

 he would go to buxton probably for the waters 	35.29988007314664

 and her boys were they getting on well at belvedere 	18.565441253181316

 father conmee was very glad indeed to hear that 	19.449823465773175

 and mr sheehy himself 	51.995606985303695

 still in london 	159.6896425278989

 the house was still sitting to be sure it was 	23.673486525224643

 beautiful weather it was delightful indeed 	50.15225514018184

 a wonderful man really 	50.56244862252854

 father conmee was very glad to see the wife of mr david sheehy <initial> <initial> iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to mr david sheehy <initial> <initial> yes he would certainly call 	18.347411033655987

 —good afternoon mrs sheehy 	41.4514038192113

 father conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun 	18.34051280318519

 and smiled yet again in going 	31.087276715890265

 he had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste 	18.35179827963832

 father conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on father bernard vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice 	14.805046975386514

 —pilate wy don’t you old back that owlin mob 	16.422015874500605

 a zealous man however 	37.5503051487105

 really he was 	80.0203943160055

 and really did great good in his way 	24.969635382478337

 beyond a doubt 	110.60091657604401

 he loved ireland he said and he loved the irish 	38.889975505717075

 of good family too would one think it 	13.242559992183912

 welsh were they not 	95.44523008758338

 that letter to father provincial 	49.444917278205

 father conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of mountjoy square 	14.7417834751344

 yes they were from belvedere 	60.55764234301417

 the little house 	136.7385189801093

 and were they good boys at school 	22.255571877520314

 <initial> that was very good now 	78.4615157355957

 and what was his name 	51.70463133963884

 jack sohan 	409.2829375256079

 and his name 	100.15932815510973

 and the other little man 	45.88934121463346

 his name was brunny lynam 	32.374165759990404

 o that was a very nice name to have 	41.42539979909021

 father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street 	16.773330501250516

 —but mind you don’t post yourself into the box little man he said 	18.934961340587236

 —well let me see if you can post a letter father conmee said 	27.234866277780164

 master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox 	21.203248773008397

 father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east 	16.094258708183826

 mr denis j maginni professor of dancing &c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignam’s court 	8.82931008085919

 was that not mrs m’guinness 	23.329938277482512

 mrs m’guinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed 	16.837875908112597

 and father conmee smiled and saluted 	30.102424655710195

 how did she do 	87.12569531892441

 like mary queen of scots something 	25.264000150056557

 and to think that she was a pawnbroker well now such <initial>  	24.064580149055992

 what should he say 	54.43648380407688

 such a queenly mien 	60.748374217132124

 father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left 	15.198524911082481

 the reverend <initial> <initial> greene <initial> <initial> will <initial> <initial> speak 	38.42056111519117

 the incumbent they called him 	28.38663490724161

 he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words 	29.63035974102167

 but one should be charitable 	70.50894363015362

 invincible ignorance 	624.1278154789171

 they acted according to their lights 	45.80520504395731

 father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road 	20.470122169435292

 it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare 	21.567189565924043

 surely there ought to be 	29.406719044910755

 a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street 	12.063394351463746

 all raised untidy caps 	40.92827707634152

 father conmee greeted them more than once benignly 	20.98140645938413

 christian brother boys 	108.92224682113262

 father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked 	23.49687302062655

 saint joseph’s church portland row 	32.66483922896268

 for aged and virtuous females 	25.059591286694943

 father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament 	37.34053593375203

 virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered 	33.91146294246124

 near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman 	19.369756842030412

 and now it was an office or something 	34.95813746041055

 father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop 	21.554438081179963

 father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter 	7.786988195498045

 in america those things were continually happening 	18.139343964085732

 unfortunate people to die like that unprepared 	54.416805302962736

 father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged 	17.628890847892453

 they saluted him and were saluted 	55.275150625763025

 a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable 	18.693183466844648

 in youkstetter’s the porkbutcher’s father conmee observed pig’s puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes 	15.388589801856316

 moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him 	9.259911438214782

 it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people 	17.61515172743979

 on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee <initial> <initial> of saint francis xavier’s church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram 	11.993001135100243

 off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley <initial> <initial> of saint agatha’s church north william street on to newcomen bridge 	12.447514107411013

 at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island 	9.694260439683523

 father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse 	12.823698641176865

 passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket 	10.804399067195792

 the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap 	22.129553050745656

 father conmee liked cheerful decorum 	27.07486451070244

 it was a peaceful day 	42.97010021487387

 the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down 	17.597016599988258

 his wife father conmee supposed 	63.489549989402455

 a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses 	32.43794576630075

 she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly 	9.473235494776791

 father conmee perceived her perfume in the car 	29.82673088301502

 he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat 	28.121503511203297

 father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head 	22.60746952640143

 at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight 	20.10512298231988

 the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her 	13.874218627635388

 she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me 	17.28776171873358

 but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures 	19.043436466346705

 from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee 	8.457057943048637

 father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver <initial> <initial> and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night 	16.08608287523481

 that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea 	11.35596610102791

 but they were god’s souls created by god 	30.245244229506223

 it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say 	14.147954083442558

 at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn 	17.7222573568501

 the malahide road was quiet 	25.46560149366312

 it pleased father conmee road and name 	29.67165619201298

 the joybells were ringing in gay malahide 	16.633528634586355

 lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining 	12.81678195258635

 then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day 	22.875454590329028

 those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony 	13.835019214615897

 a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged 	7.775140382057287

 who could know the truth 	57.90793341022115

 not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband’s brother 	9.429473442117587

 she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did 	18.133650395734957

 only god knew and she and he her husband’s brother 	28.494046218146483

 father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for man’s race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways 	16.341108432028843

 don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore 	19.61235306039502

 he was humane and honoured there 	24.561362426420168

 he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters 	10.730941490379005

 and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee 	14.508477301961578

 it was a charming day 	51.10429215465419

 the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves 	15.390918977308104

 the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind 	14.729897814898917

 moutonner the french said 	104.48898079120043

 a just and homely word 	27.324415047270122

 father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey 	9.518642100402726

 his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field 	14.043591112081858

 he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening 	21.411618970386257

 he was their rector his reign was mild 	15.0370627260736

 father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out 	16.115117640254336

 he should have read that before lunch 	38.78304147193954

 but lady maxwell had come 	33.22271043511759

 father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast 	11.196140319755429

 he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ 	5.944068536095939

 a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand 	18.60275735551441

 the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig 	11.856924416665683

 father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary 	19.49040698991663

 sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum 	5.104648944502144

 corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner 	15.414150482612564

 he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings 	13.65824710193902

 chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway 	15.873703002458283

 there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out 	14.54295421377089

 father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge 	17.259165763738473

 corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay 	10.431172199177952

 constable 57c on his beat stood to pass the time of day 	22.463716436016767

 —that’s a fine day mr kelleher 	26.097850356733503

 —ay corny kelleher said 	41.75327217962191

 —it’s very close the constable said 	21.692945772854014

 corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin 	10.669037613801699

 —what’s the best news 	29.012476241989887

 he asked 	126.58175802452861

 —i seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath 	14.676613294173384

 a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell’s corner skirting rabaiotti’s icecream car and jerked himself up eccles street 	10.631098645235026

 towards larry o’rourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably — for england  	13.5841415254159

 he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus halted and growled — home and beauty 	8.676079580331661

 what’s the time by your gold watch and chain 	23.550748948659933

 m’coy peered into marcus tertius moses’ sombre office then at o’neill’s clock 	12.334959228004625

 —after three he said 	34.796429434211284

 — <initial> madden lenehan said 	34.132046366389794

 and a game filly she is 	22.371884553460095

 while he waited in temple bar m’coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter 	14.842949552699327

 fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark 	13.910058943104236

 the gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade 	27.441718445502797

 —even money lenehan said returning 	41.905798232832154

 through here 	321.5802968877801

 they went up the steps and under merchants’ arch 	26.032022747343667

 a darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart 	26.095590581541018

 —there he is lenehan said 	39.823949585768375

 —wonder what he’s buying m’coy said glancing behind 	25.712215313694728

 — leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye lenehan said 	29.35653612725837

 —he’s dead nuts on sales m’coy said 	13.458657978117804

 i was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob 	27.134350419990202

 there were fine plates in it worth double the money the stars and the moon and comets with long tails 	15.93923600349068

 astronomy it was about 	157.06165910463284

 lenehan laughed 	738.0750116369821

 come over in the sun 	85.00165876006201

 they crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the riverwall 	27.659387214010465

 master patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangan’s late fehrenbach’s carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks 	18.414227721448377

 —there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory lenehan said eagerly 	21.338133055419572

 boiled shirt affair 	102.58004040747231

 the lord mayor was there val dillon it was and sir charles cameron and dan dawson spoke and there was music 	14.877023321975544

 bartell d’arcy sang and benjamin dollard 	16.951732115189728

 —i know m’coy broke in 	23.12712312518202

 my missus sang there once 	28.008212952506195

 —did she 	112.03505731205684

 lenehan said 	255.6194544971971

 a card unfurnished apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number <number> eccles street 	13.302755968781048

 he checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh 	19.23458886381403

 —but wait till i tell you he said 	20.022092043525035

 delahunt of camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher 	12.285915263352964

 bloom and the wife were there 	60.11548434803714

 lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice 	12.365328696918631

 fast and furious it was 	27.019723679348896

 after liquids came solids 	38.961896874023864

 —i know m’coy said 	21.33147771597822

 the year the missus was there 	24.49923691061136

 lenehan linked his arm warmly 	53.61178562386545

 —but wait till i tell you he said 	20.022092043525035

 we had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before 	20.297534084807968

 coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the featherbed mountain 	31.384354590145932

 bloom and chris callinan were on one side of the car and i was with the wife on the other 	28.730412841334967

 we started singing glees and duets lo the early beam of morning  	9.39981684677355

 she was well primed with a good load of delahunt’s port under her bellyband 	21.708167323681952

 every jolt the bloody car gave i had her bumping up against me 	16.262805288685623

 hell’s delights she has a fine pair god bless her 	27.45444039169578

 like that 	88.62984162214191

 he held his caved hands a cubit from him frowning —i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time 	11.586101064864051

 know what i mean 	54.57489890126034

 his hands moulded ample curves of air 	19.624404152017956

 he shut his eyes tight in delight his body shrinking and blew a sweet chirp from his lips 	14.556051410373527

 —the lad stood to attention anyhow he said with a sigh 	25.946720254663333

 she’s a gamey mare and no mistake 	20.710718027298487

 bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey the great bear and hercules and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot 	21.37053337701439

 but by god i was lost so to speak in the milky way 	36.23104780244251

 he knows them all faith 	58.451509246278555

 at last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away 	9.366895301389869

 and what star is that poldy 	44.53128762329302

 says she 	390.37420113608584

 by god she had bloom cornered 	47.58210820572408

 that one is it 	52.98413551737799

 says chris callinan sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick 	21.663034586776682

 by god he wasn’t far wide of the mark 	30.802366573883305

 lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall panting with soft laughter 	21.14862481984506

 —i’m weak he gasped 	22.47745352505197

 m’coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave 	16.22072246352498

 lenehan walked on again 	81.55342360324049

 he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly 	12.234982743572287

 he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m’coy 	26.244212276829618

 —he’s a cultured allroundman bloom is he said seriously 	26.42376149823194

 he’s not one of your common or garden 	26.625178603664885

 you know 	97.10413720210282

 there’s a touch of the artist about old bloom 	25.630012095395124

 mr bloom turned over idly pages of the awful disclosures of maria monk then of aristotle’s masterpiece 	16.124355456561975

 crooked botched print 	90.06014995850927

 plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows 	11.055157246972223

 lots of them like that at this moment all over the world 	32.977920551027395

 all butting with their skulls to get out of it 	23.644967848683894

 mrs purefoy 	495.0661292393519

 he laid both books aside and glanced at the third tales of the ghetto by leopold von sacher masoch 	16.169601811901423

 —that i had he said pushing it by 	45.236029868519715

 the shopman let two volumes fall on the counter 	16.888835265786344

 —them are two good ones he said 	18.871135077437156

 onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth 	36.30774639502061

 he bent to make a bundle of the other books hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain 	16.077700115801747

 on o’connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of mr denis j maginni professor of dancing & <initial> mr bloom alone looked at the titles 	10.974466341651901

 know the kind that is 	38.13250076798891

 had it 	204.69082256191018

 he opened it 	115.13983169997833

 thought so 	235.95868014872437

 a woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain 	26.392384009842214

 listen the man 	110.40498643507759

 no she wouldn’t like that much 	38.1145542392976

 got her it once 	68.20406804511232

 he read the other title sweets of sin  	27.23460904076781

 more in her line 	126.72296700818556

 let us see 	139.38410451041682

 he read where his finger opened 	41.180890612407616

 —all the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies 	14.002196488982833

 for him for raoul yes 	56.885034987622

 — her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé 	17.079341521405755

 take this 	452.62865924142466

 the end 	152.42367121767373

 —you are late he spoke hoarsely eying her with a suspicious glare 	21.010619987229575

 the beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint 	9.31072759465953

 an imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly 	19.332735788288872

 mr bloom read again the beautiful woman 	31.774207294078888

 flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes whites of eyes swooning up 	7.283247038329417

 his nostrils arched themselves for prey 	23.348458025463998

 melting breast ointments for him for raoul  	34.98221687354911

 armpits’ oniony sweat 	41.80531418057765

 fishgluey slime her heaving embonpoint  	34.081727737150764

 feel press crished sulphur dung of lions young young an elderly female no more young left the building of the courts of chancery king’s bench exchequer and common pleas having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of potterton in the admiralty division the summons exparte motion of the owners of the lady cairns versus the owners of the barque mona in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of harvey versus the ocean accident and guarantee corporation 	10.954302300660803

 phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop bulging out the dingy curtains 	25.98640199470194

 the shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face coughing 	18.84937796218998

 he raked his throat rudely puked phlegm on the floor 	15.685832173845645

 he put his boot on what he had spat wiping his sole along it and bent showing a rawskinned crown scantily haired 	12.068742996318152

 mr bloom beheld it 	57.452473679251874

 mastering his troubled breath he said —i’ll take this one 	24.82092883176252

 the shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum 	13.237832866137502

 — sweets of sin he said tapping on it 	29.79859735348412

 that’s a good one 	26.47816710777309

 the lacquey by the door of dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet 	20.530891725306855

 dilly dedalus loitering by the curbstone heard the beats of the bell the cries of the auctioneer within 	25.820211460034212

 four and nine 	118.02728656095128

 those lovely curtains 	110.83929889669501

 five shillings 	382.16210109806536

 cosy curtains 	937.3587590385135

 selling new at two guineas 	41.97872468945944

 any advance on five shillings 	23.559940884850352

 the lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it —barang bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint 	10.824003827419666

 <initial> <initial> jackson <initial> <initial> wylie <initial> munro and <initial> <initial> gahan their stretched necks wagging negotiated the curve by the college library 	13.486167845303891

 he halted near his daughter 	46.780426592335274

 —it’s time for you she said 	33.64401601402361

 —stand up straight for the love of the lord jesus mr dedalus said 	27.35615914983763

 are you trying to imitate your uncle john the cornetplayer head upon shoulder 	12.551137617439359

 melancholy god dilly shrugged her shoulders 	21.59268416980604

 mr dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back 	28.973263624769128

 —stand up straight girl he said 	23.514877944800787

 you’ll get curvature of the spine 	37.162133784240226

 do you know what you look like 	32.2597352959973

 he let his head sink suddenly down and forward hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw 	14.674711054033896

 —give it up father dilly said 	32.993439888486556

 all the people are looking at you 	28.508366526658236

 mr dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache 	17.1543454957714

 —did you get any money 	40.829164034247995

 dilly asked 	622.8714258617556

 —where would i get money 	63.731042485012736

 mr dedalus said 	36.954945406053

 there is no one in dublin would lend me fourpence 	27.16388878568233

 —you got some dilly said looking in his eyes 	27.1075518644398

 —how do you know that 	31.65655666330788

 mr kernan pleased with the order he had booked walked boldly along james’s street 	17.60222615550927

 —i know you did dilly answered 	30.1372369904808

 were you in the scotch house now 	42.78566563970266

 —i was not then mr dedalus said smiling 	32.046443267299985

 was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy 	26.438033858708

 —see if you can do anything with that he said 	31.029614506178593

 —i suppose you got five dilly said 	24.349949579198583

 give me more than that 	60.79036066128667

 —wait awhile mr dedalus said threateningly 	39.90851217577375

 you’re like the rest of them are you 	25.5508711949916

 an insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died 	13.014499873388909

 but wait awhile 	140.18159191149613

 you’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me 	24.05684864625052

 low blackguardism i’m going to get rid of you 	19.735943520875065

 wouldn’t care if i was stretched out stiff 	33.08659946573003

 he’s dead 	45.4941144038391

 the man upstairs is dead 	30.907411325028345

 he left her and walked on 	45.12919606680037

 dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat 	25.726287287700572

 —well what is it 	45.19964352058321

 he said stopping 	165.95294541576382

 the lacquey rang his bell behind their backs 	13.416921142734077

 —barang —curse your bloody blatant soul mr dedalus cried turning on him 	13.94847591701748

 the lacquey aware of comment shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly —bang mr dedalus stared at him 	10.462981893233144

 —watch him he said 	52.490707558545

 it’s instructive 	73.93955635190667

 i wonder will he allow us to talk 	26.876247152961454

 —you got more than that father dilly said 	26.854638035962566

 —i’m going to show you a little trick mr dedalus said 	19.738848058636723

 i’ll leave you all where jesus left the jews 	17.747680893677636

 look there’s all i have 	53.76309556612889

 he drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously 	18.133999805891875

 —can’t you look for some money somewhere 	37.03940329649221

 mr dedalus thought and nodded 	41.578810902587364

 —i will he said gravely 	79.38568853878253

 i looked all along the gutter in o’connell street 	18.863916163761235

 i’ll try this one now 	23.099196781625118

 —you’re very funny dilly said grinning 	21.138643244871616

 —here mr dedalus said handing her two pennies 	25.473639625497253

 get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something 	31.58023094854577

 i’ll be home shortly 	23.47985667555314

 he put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on 	24.985077575326066

 the viceregal cavalcade passed greeted by obsequious policemen out of parkgate 	17.291463892698875

 —i’m sure you have another shilling dilly said 	19.679373095299493

 the lacquey banged loudly 	32.314261791167695

 mr dedalus amid the din walked off murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently —the little nuns nice little things o sure they wouldn’t do anything o sure they wouldn’t really is it little sister monica from the sundial towards james’s gate walked mr kernan pleased with the order he had booked for pulbrook robertson boldly along james’s street past shackleton’s offices 	11.652225125981275

 got round him all right 	68.7374629018541

 how do you do mr crimmins 	45.995381497876245

 first rate sir 	105.9867730443788

 how are things going 	60.87826078812587

 just keeping alive 	102.41598958246566

 lovely weather we’re having 	51.689580543481085

 i’ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin mr crimmins 	15.083209258637758

 a small gin sir 	56.704804698536776

 terrible terrible a thousand casualties 	42.544468456933146

 and heartrending scenes 	71.79312556498385

 men trampling down women and children 	16.70347822121956

 most brutal thing 	79.1032517992363

 what do they say was the cause 	59.39029262898682

 spontaneous combustion 	1034.7733738208483

 most scandalous revelation 	95.09857939192602

 not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst 	17.802045225573313

 what i can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that 	13.949060296183754

 now you’re talking straight mr crimmins 	23.236454273616804

 you know why 	106.7563151986041

 palm oil 	387.7596739310615

 i thought we were bad here 	44.00765494668504

 i smiled at him 	61.311963396171464

 america i said quietly just like that 	37.070219641281945

 the sweepings of every country including our own 	15.221791446487803

 isn’t that true 	53.415902419866214

 that’s a fact 	31.918149638141514

 well of course where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up 	22.145236444750005

 saw him looking at my frockcoat 	50.97485965335372

 dress does it 	84.69928795506037

 nothing like a dressy appearance 	68.92863132922176

 bowls them over 	134.34481139760962

 —hello simon father cowley said 	22.629562846922887

 all i want is a little time 	64.68584704708096

 —i know mr dedalus said nodding 	32.81263900644215

 poor old bockedy ben he’s always doing a good turn for someone 	20.325344841412072

 —there he is by god he said arse and pockets 	32.000682297255516

 ben dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge 	10.801436324761609

 he came towards them at an amble scratching actively behind his coattails 	16.24107558015459

 as he came near mr dedalus greeted —hold that fellow with the bad trousers 	24.232700483568625

 —hold him now ben dollard said 	29.748070566407744

 mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben dollard’s figure 	15.204595545490863

 then turning to father cowley with a nod he muttered sneeringly —that’s a pretty garment isn’t it for a summer’s day 	19.341086194381585

 —why god eternally curse your soul ben dollard growled furiously i threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw 	12.290073615764584

 he stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff saying —they were made for a man in his health ben anyhow 	19.529865789566955

 —bad luck to the jewman that made them ben dollard said 	24.925899449938324

 cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell murmuring glassyeyed strode past the kildare street club 	8.990655077464181

 ben dollard frowned and making suddenly a chanter’s mouth gave forth a deep note 	14.26080600721496

 —aw he said 	51.396339170050915

 —that’s the style mr dedalus said nodding to its drone 	18.291847339566356

 ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward his joyful fingers in the air 	14.525432724953555

 —come along with me to the subsheriff’s office he said 	29.811444158485887

 —for a few days tell him father cowley said anxiously 	30.044454620192738

 ben dollard halted and stared his loud orifice open a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright 	11.40554474843276

 —what few days 	62.69611434532874

 john wyse nolan fell back with mr power while martin cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past micky anderson’s watches 	12.68242350783749

 —the assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble john wyse nolan told mr power 	12.179949758944202

 —and long john fanning is here too john wyse nolan said as large as life 	14.70232430307484

 —good day mr subsheriff martin cunningham said as all halted and greeted 	19.065216925988317

 damned irish language language of our forefathers 	45.49340311134217

 long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips 	14.837175984670145

 martin cunningham spoke by turns twirling the peak of his beard to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff while john wyse nolan held his peace 	13.78968475369987

 john wyse nolan came down again 	29.37489554233451

 from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering 	14.167717212891551

 gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly 	13.401991527975264

 —the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot 	16.414119794775036

 as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines —parnell’s brother 	15.12211256953501

 there in the corner 	100.88355656370408

 they chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard 	11.932247566802777

 —is that he 	55.45506877950302

 haines asked twisting round in his seat 	41.2265912395167

 —yes mulligan said 	57.160183413072716

 that’s john howard his brother our city marshal 	16.63673014291039

 john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested 	14.769926989721249

 an instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner 	12.735276493543475

 —i’ll take a mélange haines said to the waitress 	24.361105805073805

 —two mélanges buck mulligan said 	21.481963722072372

 and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well 	15.26835592678248

 when she had gone he said laughing —we call it <initial> <initial> <initial> because they have damn bad cakes 	27.594296424236767

 o but you missed dedalus on hamlet 	23.689365066980226

 haines opened his newbought book 	35.15355751611773

 the onelegged sailor growled at the area of <number> nelson street — england expects  	17.7175695289601

 buck mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter 	23.917833493075467

 —you should see him he said when his body loses its balance 	28.750202302221112

 wandering ængus i call him 	31.637932662148117

 —i am sure he has an idée fixe haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger 	12.895528640568633

 now i am speculating what it would be likely to be 	23.728121762986177

 such persons always have 	39.784698392098186

 buck mulligan bent across the table gravely 	42.42948799002035

 —they drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell 	18.016696896053045

 he will never capture the attic note 	17.597569430226457

 the note of swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth 	18.258221095319147

 buck mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come 	22.893272176167155

 he helped her to unload her tray 	26.72329162358998

 —he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth haines said amid the cheerful cups 	13.708795207337278

 the moral idea seems lacking the sense of destiny of retribution 	11.35694117285824

 rather strange he should have just that fixed idea 	24.06746776296761

 does he write anything for your movement 	33.68107089045495

 he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream 	15.095110540821643

 buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith 	9.902962195569817

 he bit off a soft piece hungrily 	38.999656054499255

 —ten years he said chewing and laughing 	44.765783858892306

 he is going to write something in ten years 	28.851630444504984

 —seems a long way off haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon 	21.026135012392277

 he strode on for clare street grinding his fierce word 	14.13754242875928

 as he strode past mr bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards having buffeted a thewless body 	9.496852687709701

 miss kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate safe from eyes low 	9.34840584359768

 from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus  	9.27881806738178

 the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest 	9.112361074000207

 the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower 	25.625528387221493

 a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble 	10.56239784700277

 beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut 	11.8217497756652

 his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast 	8.25044993046515

 from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity cuchulin conn of hundred battles niall of nine hostages brian of kincora the ardri malachi art macmurragh shane o’neill father john murphy owen roe patrick sarsfield red hugh o’donnell red jim macdermott soggarth eoghan o’growney michael dwyer francy higgins henry joy m’cracken goliath horace wheatley thomas conneff peg woffington the village blacksmith captain moonlight captain boycott dante alighieri christopher columbus <initial> fursa <initial> brendan marshal macmahon charlemagne theobald wolfe tone the mother of the maccabees the last of the mohicans the rose of castile the man for galway the man that broke the bank at monte carlo the man in the gap the woman who didn’t benjamin franklin napoleon bonaparte john <initial> sullivan cleopatra savourneen deelish julius caesar paracelsus sir thomas lipton william tell michelangelo hayes muhammad the bride of lammermoor peter the hermit peter the packer dark rosaleen patrick <initial> shakespeare brian confucius murtagh gutenberg patricio velasquez captain nemo tristan and isolde the first prince of wales thomas cook and son the bold soldier boy arrah na pogue dick turpin ludwig beethoven the colleen bawn waddler healy angus the culdee dolly mount sidney parade ben howth valentine greatrakes adam and eve arthur wellesley boss croker herodotus jack the giantkiller gautama buddha lady godiva the lily of killarney balor of the evil eye the queen of sheba acky nagle joe nagle alessandro volta jeremiah o’donovan rossa don philip o’sullivan beare 	5.215145888943628

 for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat 	9.94521214478153

 then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals 	12.275839588178837

 but he the young chief of the o’bergan’s could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze 	10.922215458879394

 thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port scion of the house of brunswick victoria her name her most excellent majesty by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea queen defender of the faith empress of india even she who bore rule a victress over many peoples the wellbeloved for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof the pale the dark the ruddy and the ethiop 	11.693621316588905

 —dead says alf 	62.56086074973793

 he’s no more dead than you are 	25.11627822672997

 in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face 	10.672657650980973

 communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus 	12.77060914487784

 questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels 	15.486848070975137

 in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them 	16.748731497529455

 interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā ālāvātār hātākāldā wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature 	10.296367900579826

 having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief 	9.371777849249046

 asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power 	12.283249585066866

 it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body 	16.91451798531974

 mind <initial> <initial> doesn’t pile it on 	34.100648871568346

 it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher manager of messrs <initial> <initial> o’neill’s popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements 	16.071863807203425

 before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good 	18.57876010011589

 he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known 	13.702896319685406

 assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction 	25.24362201254717

 he is gone from mortal haunts o’dignam sun of our morning 	20.23612646450927

 fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow 	34.73751389178298

 wail banba with your wind and wail o ocean with your whirlwind 	17.167818058720478

 —there he is again says the citizen staring out 	23.805216509363465

 says <initial> —bloom says he 	27.579130384684653

 he’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes 	21.1521111241873

 and begob i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again 	16.718231418239423

 —good christ says he 	35.77025192168423

 and says bob doran with the hat on the back of his poll lowest blackguard in dublin when he’s under the influence —who said christ is good 	19.79432545144555

 —i beg your parsnips says alf 	20.32206019785286

 —is that a good christ says bob doran to take away poor little willy dignam 	18.41283872478251

 —ah well says alf trying to pass it off 	30.254427941155956

 he’s over all his troubles 	43.59583868830342

 but bob doran shouts out of him 	30.560560262121186

 —he’s a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam 	17.379438720243904

 terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises 	19.432957439054423

 and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as you’re there 	14.363590041473316

 —the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character 	19.39062877109448

 the tear is bloody near your eye 	15.2447496323935

 talking through his bloody hat 	52.90763103941466

 fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married mooney the bumbailiff’s daughter mother kept a kip in hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour 	14.084627675844429

 —the noblest the truest says he 	18.130943398610412

 and he’s gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam 	17.037801861181837

 and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven 	17.048747814337624

 old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door 	19.29339309435146

 —come in come on he won’t eat you says the citizen 	19.83365781502368

 so bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there 	21.034710673718465

 —o christ m’keown says joe reading one of the letters 	26.26914648629609

 and he starts reading out one 	22.738867259744282

 7 hunter street liverpool 	241.4636097256205

 to the high sheriff of dublin dublin 	39.23381740777286

 honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the <number> of febuary 1900 and i hanged 	12.246883884059311

 private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when 	9.41081883221152

 —jesus says <initial> —  	51.44075029242639

 billington executed the awful murderer toad smith 	21.669314707088148

 —hold hard says joe i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain honoured sir my terms is five ginnees 	13.040987078067298

 rumbold master barber 	135.56741987494996

 —and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen 	18.99022588860195

 here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf 	44.59985988013254

 hello bloom says he what will you have 	38.39417440775638

 so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar 	17.260673683360785

 gob he’s a prudent member and no mistake 	22.860237137712147

 —give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe 	20.248032473948296

 and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it 	20.346858514965685

 —they’re all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses 	16.855580054523326

 and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull 	11.97011370393365

 in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor 	15.5927701601108

 their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord 	6.882305922612489

 so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on 	14.917341201487206

 —there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on says alf 	14.262024478840122

 —what’s that 	31.451141958913357

 —the poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged says alf 	24.685294695859536

 —that so 	97.54704237922695

 —god’s truth says alf 	39.651148022802346

 i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible 	20.785255586519355

 he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker 	34.24556421752187

 —ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said 	18.646523409881496

 —that can be explained by science says bloom 	22.21206389129754

 and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon 	18.473500001096106

 the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis 	9.277136369274045

 so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other 	18.00974167181961

 talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought 	24.555810292538

 mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs 	13.639815341674462

 and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get 	21.98620326668976

 so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him —give us the paw give the paw doggy good old doggy give the paw here give us the paw arrah bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip 	12.37572957592863

 then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs’ tin he told terry to bring 	16.73928052573229

 gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more 	21.353266180663844

 near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel 	18.992650976674682

 and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land 	10.335427973074676

 and bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face 	20.752276278724473

 phenomenon the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley 	27.730855147918053

 time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk 	17.980365635967555

 and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didn’t near roast him it’s a queer story the old one bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel 	15.883298137118889

 jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat 	15.791803218500311

 and bloom with his but don’t you see 	22.528495150959454

 and but on the other hand  	49.057643764328084

 and sure more be token the lout i’m told was in power’s after the blender’s round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment 	15.661004817847868

 phenomenon —the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom 	19.924804830204007

 —ay ay says joe 	33.39892792092124

 —you don’t grasp my point says bloom 	17.992928225086366

 — sinn fein says the citizen 	26.386121537969085

 sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us 	12.974940914551743

 the last farewell was affecting in the extreme 	31.99224831482809

 from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance 	9.86934145785652

 the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle 	9.490191891163404

 a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons 	14.19056330701134

 a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza’s plaintive muse 	9.1601095750435

 special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents 	12.57603261006552

 considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l n h n and m ll g n who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirth provoking fashion 	9.10647489652106

 our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies 	9.884233658822696

 the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat 	12.497137971263589

 the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite 	10.954986676075556

 the delegation present in full force consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbad hodenthaler countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi hiram <initial> bomboost count athanatos karamelopulos ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi señor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria hokopoko harakiri hi hung chang olaf kobberkeddelsen mynheer trik van trumps pan poleaxe paddyrisky goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch borus hupinkoff herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechli steuerli nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein 	4.2409568833435065

 all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness 	11.895550691594698

 an animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint 	14.267595162960173

 the baby policeman constable macfadden summoned by special courier from booterstown quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties 	8.17843490206655

 the readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted 	20.70908700659573

 constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> several of whom were bleeding profusely 	13.999453889480584

 the objects which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme 	9.723970947432127

 quietly unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the gladiolus cruentus  	9.76422696495639

 he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried unsuccessfully to imitate—short painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man 	8.616317928757159

 the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries hoch banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable 	7.6072639092133025

 it was exactly seventeen o’clock 	26.115242292217673

 the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance dr pippi 	10.811146822539728

 the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication 	11.002347753726546

 hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously 	13.645719749301085

 as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office 	8.805539015168751

 on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers messrs john round and sons sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim 	7.359688411747359

 the housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution 	10.62181261831645

 quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem 	10.533160725673817

 the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake 	12.203122872713825

 the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila my own  	9.972871905633813

 encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach 	13.600041814925126

 she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park 	16.46324663107469

 she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment 	14.08271727244972

 that monster audience simply rocked with delight 	14.062551621789035

 but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time 	18.619518561284547

 a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself 	10.402183735791196

 big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage 	17.927219480850773

 a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot 	10.2723542528613

 every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in albion’s history placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds 	11.928275556980081

 nay even the stern provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion 	9.69174237776343

 with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone —god blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart 	9.71358681013206

 so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland 	16.358556945252783

 antitreating is about the size of it 	43.072284906337885

 gob he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint 	21.604463024980074

 and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment don’t be talking 	11.740985509935724

 ireland sober is ireland free 	26.85752010835182

 and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of 	16.318241995921866

 and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt 	12.40708969758903

 so howandever as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me 	13.925746010851816

 i’d train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog 	24.720682668687587

 give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him 	16.047195786624464

 —afraid he’ll bite you 	50.19649276733232

 says the citizen jeering 	55.748498023540336

 —no says <initial> but he might take my leg for a lamppost 	39.767111999560754

 so he calls the old dog over 	44.719939085538705

 —what’s on you garry 	38.91893481416162

 says he 	122.45852848242734

 then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera 	20.39480032494518

 such growling you never heard as they let off between them 	23.459586259272204

 someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that 	18.14356259685373

 growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws 	24.486382657467466

 all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry 	10.40916902976556

 the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse 	9.876594372530981

 our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient celtic bards 	7.5904529017803695

 we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor <initial> <initial> <initial> points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye 	12.734789880779662

 we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication 	10.274921571240176

 the metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught 	9.427669766159978

 perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour 	12.1133078998212

 the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you barney kiernan has no sup of water to cool my courage and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights 	10.886046347102576

 so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off 	18.0677095085342

 and joe asked him would he have another 	31.28538894482089

 —i will says he a chara to show there’s no ill feeling 	23.814361632593442

 gob he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking 	35.73684760409707

 arsing around from one pub to another leaving it to your own honour with old giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators 	16.098720983269228

 entertainment for man and beast 	58.63776755140233

 and says joe —could you make a hole in another pint 	23.404383717869397

 —could a swim duck 	39.691178387373796

 says <initial> —same again terry says joe 	19.19162792794566

 are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment 	24.023110628594367

 says he 	122.45852848242734

 —thank you no says bloom 	40.32783002428326

 as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham don’t you see about this insurance of poor dignam’ <initial> martin asked me to go to the house 	18.1050626270997

 you see he dignam i mean didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy 	19.97215024737975

 —holy wars says joe laughing that’s a good one if old shylock is landed 	15.651338233500413

 so the wife comes out top dog what 	23.490635986577043

 —well that’s a point says bloom for the wife’s admirers 	40.052108646157954

 —whose admirers 	159.75827925169267

 —the wife’s advisers i mean says bloom 	31.417024661554674

 then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act 	17.06380718354518

 he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court 	16.002463591333157

 selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery 	16.43950306748817

 true as you’re there 	47.37638519603515

 o commend me to an israelite royal and privileged hungarian robbery 	15.87710118844572

 so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her 	15.949073871367904

 choking with bloody foolery 	58.33072424885519

 and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that 	19.72099189942552

 shake hands brother 	134.93128461842738

 you’re a rogue and i’m another 	20.78713423533594

 —let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour 	12.788552366164438

 but should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness 	15.651387095911947

 —no rejoined the other i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup 	11.8179317734744

 —then suffer me to take your hand said he 	27.77668269006034

 the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were i to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech 	9.520716985126354

 and off with him and out trying to walk straight 	38.08394395363897

 boosed at five o’clock 	36.592158631519865

 night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby 14a 	17.799698497151716

 and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls joseph manuo and talking against the catholic religion and he serving mass in adam and eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote the new testament and the old testament and hugging and smugging 	14.603844971812112

 and the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another 	17.58513223306209

 how is your testament 	97.20123588043633

 have you got an old testament 	55.01523065123846

 only paddy was passing there i tell you what 	22.012448866500673

 then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her no less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady 	22.848124042585095

 jack mooney’s sister 	72.1871242695353

 and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples 	19.76367335851016

 gob jack made him toe the line 	28.085194934617355

 told him if he didn’t patch up the pot jesus he’d kick the shite out of him 	20.64609186786077

 so terry brought the three pints 	43.808653520491255

 —here says joe doing the honours 	47.33581595684542

 here citizen 	534.8313674943955

 — slan leat says he 	25.82781075220797

 —who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty alf 	29.585163897836814

 —friend of yours says alf 	38.5993435834944

 the mimber 	412.19355093331507

 —i won’t mention any names says alf 	17.265964728845475

 —i thought so says joe 	39.39033602427223

 i saw him up at that meeting now with william field <initial> <initial> the cattle traders 	19.813361086866653

 —hairy iopas says the citizen that exploded volcano the darling of all countries and the idol of his own 	15.145237468696587

 so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue 	17.105834785681594

 because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard 	45.71391482994936

 walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier 	19.18296001744206

 mister knowall 	513.5289003785446

 teach your grandmother how to milk ducks 	29.210061642847297

 pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o’dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her 	15.260431347785614

 couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it 	11.46318851516544

 what’s your programme today 	34.114745981591334

 humane methods 	863.1427089492986

 because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently 	16.249163872684314

 gob he’d have a soft hand under a hen 	37.275301372761

 ga ga gara 	99.87860543579718

 klook klook klook 	77.33140576461874

 you’re sure 	50.59208425983971

 —nannan’s going too says joe 	36.874860879915204

 the league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding irish games in the park 	15.81686901309211

 what do you think of that citizen 	49.07984208988845

 the sluagh na h eireann  	20.04628884260514

 mr cowe conacre multifarnham 	36.93948786787624

 arising out of the question of my honourable friend the member for shillelagh may i ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition 	11.138414539408453

 mr allfours tamoshant 	109.32908211877506

 honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house 	21.629605337930805

 i feel i cannot usefully add anything to that 	16.26583428037586

 the answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative 	45.940020510285535

 have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the phoenix park 	12.458453680491404

 mr allfours the answer is in the negative 	38.81024588987117

 mr cowe conacre has the right honourable gentleman’s famous mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the treasury bench 	14.812804926120787

 ironical opposition cheers 	140.84751472168972

 the speaker order order the house rises 	28.177300208428555

 —there’s the man says joe that made the gaelic sports revival 	20.566841106632538

 there he is sitting there 	42.46320494576667

 the man that got away james stephens 	19.926849626029174

 the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot 	16.95744261762553

 what was your best throw citizen 	38.72097949577383

 — na bacleis says the citizen letting on to be modest 	25.668116159517105

 there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow 	35.850342293464664

 —put it there citizen says joe 	35.49552642459026

 —is that really a fact 	39.47531545469896

 says alf 	145.60422801079014

 —yes says bloom 	47.716832196043065

 that’s well known 	38.197925540141796

 did you not know that 	66.4822923612672

 so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that 	10.930313711901452

 and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad 	18.607643348494292

 i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at bloom 	28.1251387589828

 do you see that straw 	55.583678028798595

 that’s a straw  	36.7600017410193

 declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady 	31.145210114257118

 a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian o’ciarnain’s in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na h eireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race 	10.788529899534629

 after an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers 	11.808714415030108

 it was a knockout clean and clever 	22.72019082222112

 a large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to nagyaságos uram lipóti virag late of messrs alexander thom’s printers to his majesty on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of százharminczbrojúgulyás dugulás meadow of murmuring waters  	9.666255884476707

 the bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street 	17.578856596516722

 the catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect 	16.592962565693945

 the observatory of dunsink registered in all eleven shocks all of the fifth grade of mercalli’s scale and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534 the year of the rebellion of silken thomas 	11.595514293280038

 the epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the inn’s quay ward and parish of saint michan covering a surface of fortyone acres two roods and one square pole or perch 	9.98947242480329

 all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive 	14.3784093000713

 and he shouting to the bloody dog —after him garry after him boy and the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb 	17.415193856201785

 and they beheld him in the chariot clothed upon in the glory of the brightness having raiment as of the sun fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon him 	16.451229776116914

 and there came a voice out of heaven calling elijah elijah and he answered with a main cry abba adonai and they beheld him even him ben bloom elijah amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over donohoe’s in little green street like a shot off a shovel 	12.323763647760222

 <number> the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace 	14.15038977436349

 the three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly 	20.748295813750033

 <initial> <initial> belleisle printed on both 	25.20612686940659

 for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them 	7.929639461250346

 they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long 	14.109297588595998

 and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight 	11.423154120180985

 he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words 	12.552826159713806

 cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin 	21.086044847247482

 —now baby cissy caffrey said 	31.389695890378494

 say out big big 	48.75869256110932

 i want a drink of water 	40.292168145078435

 and baby prattled after her —a jink a jink a jawbo 	15.098284731409782

 cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on 	11.240116494621832

 what a persuasive power that girl had but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib 	14.619622366773456

 none of your spoilt beauties flora macflimsy sort was cissy caffrey 	10.580414991043941

 a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme 	16.297512213280672

 and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother 	19.390359272339424

 but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky 	20.94802923238158

 boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule 	18.277196548793132

 the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had 	13.210053469737751

 needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends 	19.20025468514907

 —come here tommy his sister called imperatively 	25.44865562742168

 at once and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand 	21.93741183389873

 wait till i catch you for that 	28.507025204114463

 his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins 	13.585396992462565

 and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure 	32.72139823473671

 his little man o’ war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit 	14.748014915924848

 still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition 	14.16119117741387

 —nasty bold jacky she cried 	24.51397169057236

 she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly —what’s your name 	16.61486931308665

 butter and cream 	115.68896297232415

 —tell us who is your sweetheart spoke edy boardman 	24.549414612179504

 is cissy your sweetheart 	33.655120253385924

 —nao tearful tommy said 	26.054755147993184

 —is edy boardman your sweetheart 	33.082625986280824

 —nao tommy said 	50.30166986653624

 —i know edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes 	14.014226608751375

 i know who is tommy’s sweetheart 	47.412165611510694

 gerty is tommy’s sweetheart 	54.763066672010694

 cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes 	16.7381110956604

 but who was gerty 	122.48701891598583

 gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see 	11.6744651022846

 she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell 	13.189861631687808

 her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling 	11.76618117590334

 the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid’s bow greekly perfect 	12.127847757296394

 her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either 	11.43054451082937

 bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again 	15.170522167199367

 there was an innate refinement a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep 	9.631083270728043

 had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her 	11.216646485763023

 mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist 	11.961885334220648

 why have women such eyes of witchery 	25.648416052464693

 gerty’s were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows 	15.613900264248594

 time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive 	18.913816576268704

 it was madame vera verity directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it 	12.658702904876854

 then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose 	16.12506805911293

 that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one 	24.87682551311717

 but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair 	20.741728424082613

 it was dark brown with a natural wave in it 	26.24746714734561

 she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth 	12.042001545750113

 and just now at edy’s words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal 	15.488371238823834

 for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes 	22.01598322673319

 she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue 	20.17896465774541

 inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent 	28.395100714349155

 the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning 	17.60553892296354

 she knew right well no one better what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel 	15.394957882536236

 as per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window 	18.662660565747135

 only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother <initial> <initial> wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university 	20.633660647028172

 little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core 	13.886574097038514

 yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time 	27.755831589266545

 but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden 	19.230759688556425

 gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out 	17.16439847020026

 a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the lady’s pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection 	11.125870511010394

 she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone 	9.692001799056158

 her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep 	9.111146659328092

 her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops 	8.578772977573694

 as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her 	12.438098860094186

 she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things 	8.55401378143627

 she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday 	15.4405281898744

 and yet and yet that strained look on her face a gnawing sorrow is there all the time 	14.898591502418796

 her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror 	16.018492740957946

 you are lovely gerty it said 	27.056677271853584

 gerty macdowell yearns in vain 	30.189277630689155

 yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie <initial> <initial> <initial> because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be 	12.663273508961627

 he was too young to understand 	38.60207850579423

 he would not believe in love a woman’s birthright 	43.489123315213085

 the night of the party long ago in stoer’s he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips 	18.925271854058504

 he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments 	21.462881756563924

 impetuous fellow strength of character had never been reggy wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men 	16.117675394847502

 but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over 	21.040932400229316

 no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss 	12.449517187927553

 it would be like heaven 	53.23420941558373

 for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve 	14.42968976800584

 with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward 	11.433456955967639

 and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be 	15.7407580674818

 then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november 	19.08344153958047

 she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess 	12.30199368341521

 her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap’s lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses 	9.584237115052161

 he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes 	11.581521036954578

 edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight 	21.611476963334443

 but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please 	22.344394178167438

 the temper of him o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies 	25.60604270488294

 edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him 	31.24207573398062

 —you’re not my sister naughty tommy said 	16.351074082656435

 it’s my ball 	38.963707689275985

 but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day 	15.726005581723973

 —anything for a quiet life laughed ciss 	39.821019566406015

 and she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor here’s his two horses here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin 	12.71907168053103

 but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him 	14.307119080331885

 —i’d like to give him something she said so i would where i won’t say 	20.49777113544136

 —on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily 	30.213647277476714

 but not a pin cared ciss 	56.79314400991654

 —let him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose 	29.642730227894262

 give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him 	31.115808332789175

 madcap ciss with her golliwog curls 	43.66286437622623

 you had to laugh at her sometimes 	42.36663729938345

 for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white 	16.14439194995741

 that was just like cissycu <title> o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette 	17.298847330076196

 there was none to come up to her for fun 	37.33712039287314

 but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome 	16.194853834394763

 and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ 	27.607397230843972

 it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes <initial> <initial> rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament 	15.83796444052644

 they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins 	11.760324346787785

 but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days 	9.207825838118126

 nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low 	18.1456880329853

 and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful 	15.174578178924493

 and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk 	12.758395089252717

 you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose 	19.676587321832844

 poor father with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke 	11.845142520190464

 her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken 	17.66874853975847

 no one would have thought the end was so near 	36.626238567831926

 now he was laid to rest 	52.085036570315985

 and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home 	16.858247688188047

 a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold 	15.148733063446835

 and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff 	10.709712093305678

 everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways 	52.0635538393398

 it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window 	11.89283338148713

 you could see there was a story behind it 	36.40898101760296

 the colours were done something lovely 	20.74221024348823

 she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat 	25.996276970500677

 she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant 	14.893462895816107

 the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks 	11.63591144198523

 needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball 	12.08424112512211

 our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please 	14.810813904970953

 the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock 	17.130442023563205

 the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed 	15.152484191093134

 —if you fail try again edy boardman said 	21.36873721150586

 gerty smiled assent and bit her lip 	17.285869028202985

 a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle 	13.918516007487382

 pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking 	20.3932566520041

 she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks 	11.19575744657401

 through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose 	11.161707222960295

 and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her 	11.790996698434117

 the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers 	10.26079163332043

 cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air 	11.597017787548944

 peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my word didn’t the little chap enjoy that and then she told him to say papa 	19.13156021516442

 —say papa baby 	66.2698034620384

 say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa 	10.415933975105437

 and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said 	16.326798709616952

 —haja ja ja haja 	29.51032296684424

 of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it —habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa 	8.046623123698348

 and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks 	13.905537171916425

 it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased 	13.602267982401672

 gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins 	17.97338136994226

 it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft 	20.51294322007452

 and while she gazed her heart went pitapat 	19.31674752630244

 yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look 	36.63643530879456

 his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul 	14.020610315684289

 wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them 	21.00842401123767

 people were so queer 	85.69768547530508

 she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting 	14.360743281521094

 he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face 	21.74094972210272

 she would have given worlds to know what it was 	27.39240985707328

 he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down 	18.351038896582452

 she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away 	20.53629283145488

 here was that of which she had so often dreamed 	47.16260563591864

 it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else 	23.14645434433917

 the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him 	25.718046379984315

 if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not 	11.618434526346581

 even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her 	16.561817691638428

 there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm 	16.379795180940786

 she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past 	13.95088025903454

 then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone 	12.889781610464132

 refuge of sinners 	116.83208228013542

 comfortress of the afflicted 	352.04532270227725

 ora pro nobis  	118.85115928074111

 well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart 	12.599802944140086

 gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down 	17.28708373756296

 he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic 	16.280641398057323

 he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word 	19.255838372593477

 he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place 	14.989065923438936

 the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it 	13.996419508064252

 little monkeys common as ditchwater 	25.109208781247737

 someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them 	23.40026927022084

 and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned 	22.09819955153448

 she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it 	18.166181371608122

 she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible 	17.707256500983213

 it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble 	14.234674276336184

 tableau that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness 	30.602826743960435

 queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum  	14.637849596617544

 three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow’s of george’s street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself 	15.64049873038936

 cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature 	18.42082487614814

 gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness 	13.379799624970131

 you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that 	16.885534979491062

 she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve 	15.454118275234816

 she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes 	14.642156133811108

 he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey 	22.497519022470733

 her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose 	17.36320840533294

 edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby 	12.102117708861687

 irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers 	21.02427149254846

 replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth 	26.39055429222126

 i was only wondering was it late 	38.306360492033185

 because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late 	16.807541585603804

 and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again 	15.552024686795978

 but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early 	32.33075916640954

 —wait said cissy i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum 	17.551472919579506

 so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church 	20.634198020699436

 passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself 	25.3834082080571

 one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure 	17.895570467179976

 cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set 	17.77607772216594

 his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones 	23.06678692250132

 cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order 	19.887749255088107

 then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time 	18.013659608151553

 it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets 	24.21160827056201

 she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon 	20.145251515164297

 his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine 	15.131361393062319

 if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face 	22.939709080795197

 it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it 	30.14375006203509

 edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over 	13.684742298559588

 gerty winced sharply 	97.78002809625313

 a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable 	15.006598839784377

 it hurt—o yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was 	13.358804753156118

 gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of 	9.77515780667348

 she had loved him better than he knew 	28.185874188984577

 lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears 	19.68683927262268

 their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see 	13.243218960182098

 —o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up 	16.565063258305877

 i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year 	18.004645404097822

 her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily 	14.083847251509615

 there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with 	28.222696855649914

 as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces 	15.656138967194545

 and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot 	15.80992476001674

 miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it 	14.312852554441749

 edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior 	17.561431911177564

 and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib 	13.098110129642402

 —o my puddeny pie protested ciss 	18.805415907306767

 he has his bib destroyed 	36.378053853438786

 the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights 	10.58453648034191

 gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands 	14.470862459684328

 how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry 	14.474842840931961

 and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of mabel vaughan and other tales 	10.936154029611314

 for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of 	20.52026065688754

 she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean 	13.3894622923901

 it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs 	11.379780746529901

 art thou real my ideal 	28.409230282077242

 it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever 	11.337231078409435

 and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it 	12.220109568895376

 but it must end she felt 	43.052354727841035

 if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her 	19.21433929563573

 love laughs at locksmiths 	46.790681909309065

 she would make the great sacrifice 	70.2902949089114

 her every effort would be to share his thoughts 	19.952042412631165

 dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness 	21.586773645744834

 there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind 	19.7427276153417

 but even if—what then 	66.54135784957028

 would it make a very great difference 	37.84633681987229

 from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled 	15.445776693291377

 she loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station 	13.647461832181765

 no no not that 	89.10751372979857

 they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess 	21.022503241331535

 perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall 	30.743505104673392

 she thought she understood 	85.60615448693126

 she would try to understand him because men were so different 	23.459279665104717

 the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes 	13.164226921746371

 heart of mine she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide 	25.30237444102737

 nothing else mattered 	136.73243911110433

 come what might she would be wild untrammelled free 	23.957439990076793

 canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out —o look cissy and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple 	13.046722815524918

 —it’s fireworks cissy caffrey said 	29.12620241641566

 and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running 	18.634360896471872

 —come on gerty cissy called 	29.689761120137383

 it’s the bazaar fireworks 	28.501220518662105

 but gerty was adamant 	76.55123528357475

 she had no intention of being at their beck and call 	21.054774725074736

 if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was 	18.773784620639855

 the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling 	15.023033170213756

 she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her 	25.99183392180419

 whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his 	27.756942465080304

 at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips 	14.158267037225873

 his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her 	17.81107733715057

 she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed 	15.044899710428762

 but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips 	23.036687716378676

 besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did 	14.710463611609065

 and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark 	17.427027331220398

 and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking 	13.461374668129775

 she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl’s love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages 	15.989051078257356

 and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o and everyone cried o o in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent 	10.015256759384172

 ah she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl 	12.870546582179186

 he was leaning back against the rock behind 	36.08187352166054

 leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes 	18.029798579044858

 what a brute he had been at it again 	32.8696986785536

 a fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered 	19.998124758099216

 an utter cad he had been he of all men but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered 	16.144284360734662

 should a girl tell 	64.73448156551518

 no a thousand times no 	31.178654291124847

 that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell 	13.012453699227985

 cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried —gerty gerty we’re going 	18.9928049266406

 come on 	163.39298862566946

 we can see from farther up 	52.662901190926334

 gerty had an idea one of love’s little ruses 	41.202032329900575

 wonder if he’s too far to 	38.72773397932961

 she rose 	480.3771187964162

 was it goodbye 	104.40595460767285

 she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve 	22.848002767063498

 she drew herself up to her full height 	41.783698265126475

 their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face 	17.66184034137384

 she half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted 	11.80859033099047

 slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman 	11.798423958451728

 it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed 	18.568188063404033

 tight boots 	587.368101096505

 she’s lame o mr bloom watched her as she limped away 	22.956707320696907

 poor girl that’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint 	30.32324518992814

 all are 	254.10332842603339

 daresay she felt <initial> when you feel like that you often meet what you feel 	26.109727931961732

 liked me or what 	55.720218432733596

 dress they look at 	47.729219418834454

 always know a fellow courting collars and cuffs 	20.130412969367985

 well cocks and lions do the same and stags 	21.731040171925024

 same time might prefer a tie undone or something 	12.592452669592038

 suppose i when i was 	39.78818956304302

 gently does it 	62.68824086205794

 dislike rough and tumble 	58.48759545355138

 kiss in the dark and never tell 	49.71349741746149

 saw something in me 	63.7332373431665

 wonder what 	312.20533134564437

 sooner have me as i am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair lovelock over his dexter optic 	11.253100321383377

 ought to attend to my appearance my age 	21.937909371230845

 didn’t let her see me in profile 	34.1569387376521

 still you never know 	64.89735440388947

 beauty and the beast 	145.19981654481592

 besides i can’t be so if molly 	33.97748232738977

 took off her hat to show her hair 	33.70868434744568

 wide brim 	311.21135924375983

 bought to hide her face meeting someone might know her bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell 	11.844734189777691

 hair strong in rut 	44.08204975102409

 ten bob i got for molly’s combings when we were on the rocks in holles street 	22.588253895923366

 why not 	307.03206171125805

 suppose he gave her money 	79.5657121103427

 why not 	307.03206171125805

 all a prejudice 	106.66061386122544

 she’s worth ten fifteen more a pound 	22.319536209797004

 i think so 	142.68944507686393

 all that for nothing 	103.98120958821414

 bold hand mrs marion 	48.877176202069265

 and the day i went to drimmie’s without a necktie 	30.522386202418776

 wrangle with molly it was put me off 	39.97700136104195

 no i remember 	125.22256558991633

 richie goulding he’s another 	58.15773531854372

 weighs on his mind 	166.37121631169472

 funny my watch stopped at half past four 	20.98915956174909

 could do it myself 	93.85480175285473

 was that just when he she 	41.8725105943488

 o he did 	98.55486080733755

 into her 	153.32931084532456

 she did 	285.94031755680766

 o lord that little limping devil 	37.697551556465996

 begins to feel cold and clammy 	36.61755437475801

 aftereffect not pleasant 	165.97558755008933

 still you have to get rid of it someway 	52.38648095297467

 they don’t care 	42.2137351880934

 complimented perhaps 	863.0027081775467

 go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies 	16.032013269907203

 well aren’t they 	53.36675826816871

 see her as she is spoil all 	43.95893397132946

 must have the stage setting the rouge costume position music 	15.525345837519232

 amours of actresses 	164.7805274155033

 nell gwynn mrs bracegirdle maud branscombe 	19.218012485105728

 curtain up 	542.2636172745074

 moonlight silver effulgence 	101.03132959158043

 maiden discovered with pensive bosom 	25.823563302705175

 still i feel 	138.19165082889825

 the strength it gives a man 	28.837091758787523

 that’s the secret of it 	24.361242587165012

 good job i let off there behind the wall coming out of dignam’ <initial> cider that was 	22.81175978943666

 otherwise i couldn’t have 	32.00198136524797

 makes you want to sing after 	62.75739079072765

 lacaus esant taratara  	126.15897988484323

 suppose i spoke to her 	47.13901861496522

 what about 	240.56636482519153

 bad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation 	19.63944557991563

 ask them a question they ask you another 	32.820971752492575

 good idea if you’re stuck 	42.39119980010603

 gain time 	755.1022678178286

 but then you’re in a cart 	47.06278396936034

 wonderful of course if you say good evening and you see she’s on for it good evening 	32.527690744870185

 o but the dark evening in the appian way i nearly spoke to mrs clinch o thinking she was 	17.877577162412436

 whew girl in meath street that night 	30.262191644860504

 all the dirty things i made her say 	37.05454786947585

 all wrong of course 	49.731797244113224

 my arks she called it 	25.376877044188376

 it’s so hard to find one who 	25.958480334488897

 aho if you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden 	23.54918691186044

 and kissed my hand when i gave her the extra two shillings 	22.93745569915538

 press the button and the bird will squeak 	34.00022659275745

 wish she hadn’t called me sir 	29.798452415046885

 o her mouth in the dark and you a married man with a single girl that’s what they enjoy 	30.71166468020618

 taking a man from another woman 	52.093885846284586

 or even hear of it 	33.55006767390801

 different with me 	83.41369904027464

 glad to get away from other chap’s wife 	42.5955445954466

 eating off his cold plate 	61.25230338662893

 chap in the burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle 	20.024791458020527

 french letter still in my pocketbook 	44.72829641772254

 cause of half the trouble 	53.83217112937263

 but might happen sometime i don’t think 	16.623249161507005

 come in all is prepared 	107.56536663618827

 i dreamt 	480.15015719025985

 worst is beginning 	127.45848036166737

 how they change the venue when it’s not what they like 	26.184040341543692

 ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who 	28.54872713250405

 or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped 	23.74999259196161

 yet if i went the whole hog say i want to something like that 	23.901307328241423

 because i did 	161.24628691790952

 she too 	422.2010232558332

 offend her 	930.9791848051888

 pretend to want something awfully then cry off for her sake 	16.624126004591403

 flatters them 	1033.6689876396658

 she must have been thinking of someone else all the time 	24.495326143297913

 what harm 	440.3202216670063

 must since she came to the use of reason he he and he 	29.435781610986734

 first kiss does the trick 	33.31189690249558

 the propitious moment 	79.48267240283924

 something inside them goes pop 	32.893826232108566

 mushy like tell by their eye on the sly 	31.853267242761635

 first thoughts are best 	48.17271607527273

 remember that till their dying day 	29.795041858706167

 molly lieutenant mulvey that kissed her under the moorish wall beside the gardens 	15.967243423767277

 fifteen she told me 	58.891860691847015

 but her breasts were developed 	34.06545311303299

 fell asleep then 	67.95589630185688

 after glencree dinner that was when we drove home 	31.514162072348736

 featherbed mountain 	517.3730941223149

 gnashing her teeth in sleep 	46.49938269241813

 lord mayor had his eye on her too 	52.063410466836814

 val dillon 	517.3705455938118

 there she is with them down there for the fireworks 	58.054643601489666

 my fireworks 	481.20475776605025

 up like a rocket down like a stick 	36.47635937955048

 want to be grownups 	125.61103962701418

 dressing in mother’s clothes 	52.672553412139855

 time enough understand all the ways of the world 	30.499425612319925

 and the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth 	33.45453692701576

 i knew she could whistle 	81.41094148632831

 mouth made for that 	48.8943492561953

 like molly 	401.7443349920354

 why that highclass whore in jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose 	20.78097263199483

 would you mind please telling me the right time 	25.964229295035967

 i’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane 	26.649755277607767

 caressing the little boy too 	74.07946945507643

 onlookers see most of the game 	77.39447457353727

 of course they understand birds animals babies 	14.410856079180201

 in their line 	126.44632705313644

 didn’t look back when she was going down the strand 	32.93608349352536

 wouldn’t give that satisfaction 	35.11408518026297

 those girls those girls those lovely seaside girls 	13.4435795416202

 fine eyes she had clear 	80.03069811773224

 it’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil 	22.214457765658643

 did she know what i 	44.31918209178446

 like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump 	34.146583988133585

 women never meet one like that wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of venus with all his belongings on show 	16.117379040159364

 call that innocence 	141.79603148999237

 poor idiot his wife has her work cut out for her 	21.936371562022263

 never see them sit on a bench marked wet paint  	25.366639709517226

 eyes all over them 	68.6390008527176

 look under the bed for what’s not there 	48.110490907516805

 longing to get the fright of their lives 	35.06814964067141

 sharp as needles they are 	27.029051706175363

 when i said to molly the man at the corner of cuffe street was goodlooking thought she might like twigged at once he had a false arm 	17.97798039221971

 had too 	242.89981018028394

 where do they get that 	65.40804166297364

 typist going up roger greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings 	22.1393251059225

 handed down from father to mother to daughter i mean 	21.430975326507703

 bred in the bone 	166.60347623388955

 milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing 	22.77847400777427

 best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror 	29.462726205510066

 and when i sent her for molly’s paisley shawl to prescott’s by the way that ad i must carrying home the change in her stocking clever little minx 	16.698972371867754

 i never told her 	58.08693095731254

 neat way she carries parcels too 	26.71311743099807

 attract men small thing like that 	23.447139131734975

 holding up her hand shaking it to let the blood flow back when it was red 	28.556693270785534

 who did you learn that from 	51.887145386634266

 something the nurse taught me 	35.23058503711876

 o don’t they know three years old she was in front of molly’s dressingtable just before we left lombard street west 	16.629696947247595

 me have a nice pace 	65.18661687992481

 ways of the world 	85.84724571998028

 young student 	197.34526090135927

 still she was game 	172.13524615921727

 lord i am wet 	152.1891518836877

 devil you are 	103.62818443201006

 swell of her calf 	196.8787227132325

 transparent stockings stretched to breaking point 	22.55756595382284

 not like that frump today 	49.53065959951862

 <initial> <initial> rumpled stockings 	50.72176592275892

 or the one in grafton street 	43.35867791762151

 wow beef to the heel 	114.61571388230092

 a monkey puzzle rocket burst spluttering in darting crackles 	9.261512879127997

 zrads and zrads zrads zrads 	28.46845066654696

 and cissy and tommy and jacky ran out to see and edy after with the pushcar and then gerty beyond the curve of the rocks 	21.833527157055652

 will she 	247.41099884544172

 watch watch see looked round 	26.596175125999128

 she smelt an onion 	52.44890285560481

 darling i saw your 	112.06922878764307

 i saw all 	129.36148656852916

 lord did me good all the same 	22.167590370993814

 off colour after kiernan’s dignam’ <initial> for this relief much thanks 	19.5576366370386

 in hamlet that is 	42.61817992811383

 lord it was all things combined 	78.207604288854

 when she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue 	22.099339597085404

 your head it simply swirls 	27.138440968741314

 he’s right 	43.14274702191136

 might have made a worse fool of myself however 	25.40936409448463

 instead of talking about nothing 	63.50357235208461

 still it was a kind of language between us 	38.739040405203575

 it couldn’t be 	37.83521182220479

 might be false name however like my name and the address dolphin’s barn a blind 	20.49702010146822

 place made me think of that i suppose 	35.41624908154985

 all tarred with the same brush 	66.90549674195395

 wiping pens in their stockings 	69.16013843367494

 but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood 	40.681552432691404

 every bullet has its billet 	30.34368093587303

 course i never could throw anything straight at school 	19.321581051270993

 crooked as a ram’s horn 	85.77750144466697

 sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah 	16.25731578408533

 no soft job 	119.7532248086836

 saves them 	1033.6689876396658

 keeps them out of harm’s way 	52.67968523587831

 washing child washing corpse 	46.35919973151604

 children’s hands always round them 	34.404941650952644

 cocoanut skulls monkeys not even closed at first sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds 	14.241805836248611

 oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck 	20.506051316611394

 fill it up with wind 	108.27594970107702

 mrs beaufoy purefoy 	117.18596184769244

 must call to the hospital 	91.343266447537

 wonder is nurse callan there still 	27.685813490615324

 she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace 	20.88826816631273

 that young doctor o’hare i noticed her brushing his coat 	16.920436996667366

 and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too marriageable 	26.10090308046681

 worst of all at night mrs duggan told me in the city ar <title> husband rolling in drunk stink of pub off him like a polecat 	15.6031167473536

 have that in your nose in the dark whiff of stale boose 	32.08031691217403

 then ask in the morning was i drunk last night 	27.707129386867038

 bad policy however to fault the husband 	16.4147277625224

 chickens come home to roost 	63.0429444524873

 they stick by one another like glue 	34.952628330856534

 maybe the women’s fault also 	55.69096226626505

 that’s where molly can knock spots off them 	12.924823476577448

 it’s the blood of the south 	29.300984790821776

 also the form the figure 	58.62723131810372

 hands felt for the opulent 	45.0142671837603

 just compare for instance those others 	30.81202733784057

 wife locked up at home skeleton in the cupboard 	43.375597137859074

 allow me to introduce my 	75.89522414611736

 then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript wouldn’t know what to call her 	18.550104641226174

 always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife 	36.746005985270976

 still there’s destiny in it falling in love 	33.17267806418481

 have their own secrets between them 	32.842688819591714

 chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand 	26.34705353648261

 then little chits of girls height of a shilling in coppers with little hubbies 	15.881718638204067

 as god made them he matched them 	20.805419163031857

 sometimes children turn out well enough 	25.850139585856002

 twice nought makes one 	40.40698844070799

 or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride 	12.292932807998515

 marry in may and repent in december 	20.18023809060766

 this wet is very unpleasant 	38.06239885453318

 well the foreskin is not back 	31.853507311948306

 better detach 	682.4991760498547

 ow other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket 	34.832893102940446

 long and the short of it 	67.73593522002282

 big he and little she 	66.01414401078969

 very strange about my watch 	35.53581493278998

 wristwatches are always going wrong 	57.29133296145788

 wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he 	27.485774938488863

 yes i suppose at once 	58.518756501072424

 cat’s away the mice will play 	32.51371078912447

 i remember looking in pill lane 	28.560084674596983

 also that now is magnetism 	62.386473204458376

 back of everything magnetism 	49.631630031082025

 earth for instance pulling this and being pulled 	24.459538411786284

 that causes movement 	84.32679261251859

 and time well that’s the time the movement takes 	19.72327056430096

 then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit 	15.805379868172684

 because it’s all arranged 	55.62669452801579

 magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun the stars 	25.353762632462953

 little piece of steel iron 	46.55894527950588

 when you hold out the fork 	48.560958320196924

 woman and man that is 	51.91839968929495

 fork and steel 	106.65035611696028

 molly he 	623.4222344435219

 dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and like a sneeze coming legs look look and if you have any guts in you 	17.066818016380886

 have to let fly 	86.42134353125947

 wonder how is she feeling in that region 	43.00102442574427

 shame all put on before third person 	26.60916285375021

 more put out about a hole in her stocking 	36.556496059147065

 molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show 	18.11270642991223

 and when the painters were in lombard street west 	15.716008836268369

 fine voice that fellow had 	60.99486834260829

 how giuglini began 	103.26870648724135

 smell that i did 	109.70330032272759

 like flowers 	387.8405511518731

 it was too 	73.91424648880364

 came from the turpentine probably in the paint 	44.24166782369237

 make their own use of everything 	51.20780792323906

 same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear 	16.50767553703991

 but lots of them can’t kick the beam i think 	23.881752910526515

 keep that thing up for hours 	48.964077166954645

 kind of a general all round over me and half down my back 	27.496563988127292

 that’s her perfume 	23.750742676116854

 why she waved her hand 	44.54507140033486

 i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow 	25.692002083725693

 roses i think 	91.2339042843296

 she’d like scent of that kind 	37.75565757145678

 sweet and cheap soon sour 	36.33559668546785

 why molly likes opoponax 	58.49205108329756

 suits her with a little jessamine mixed 	54.18912859798404

 at the dance night she met him dance of the hours 	28.257419207458774

 heat brought it out 	63.29043516066578

 she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before 	37.98816711163921

 good conductor is it 	45.96433075341963

 or bad 	354.7733851672311

 suppose there’s some connection 	54.33397637766831

 for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark 	28.77109137979798

 mysterious thing too 	118.233120325259

 why did i smell it only now 	37.89810191635181

 took its time in coming like herself slow but sure 	10.076586058834817

 suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across 	19.295314857751816

 yes it is 	78.72921962518159

 because those spice islands cinghalese this morning smell them leagues off 	11.673749796947689

 tell you what it is 	52.49434134214738

 it’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you call it gossamer and they’re always spinning it out of them fine as anything like rainbow colours without knowing it 	13.493095255861208

 clings to everything she takes off 	32.16090056711423

 vamp of her stockings 	219.45152651908964

 warm shoe 	311.1969384001391

 drawers little kick taking them off 	18.75963156029472

 byby till next time 	60.40104408393533

 also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed 	24.991104675575276

 know her smell in a thousand 	47.795850795951424

 bathwater too 	862.3351916803296

 reminds me of strawberries and cream 	27.91191477639381

 wonder where it is really 	119.7307172940011

 there or the armpits or under the neck 	37.69586192219667

 because you get it out of all holes and corners 	33.8637400454262

 hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something 	14.59422361135552

 bag under their tails 	70.02241447798858

 one grain pour off odour for years 	15.311594090111317

 dogs at each other behind 	66.56389464508217

 how do you sniff 	97.1058208826951

 very well thank you 	42.85943121480663

 animals go by that 	54.80836084069488

 yes now look at it that way 	47.44295962881542

 we’re the same 	39.11599769712281

 some women instance warn you off when they have their period 	21.6328420017474

 come near 	514.3166595294988

 then get a hogo you could hang your hat on 	21.02814058680216

 like what 	342.80945819951984

 potted herrings gone stale or 	28.86854372357709

 boof please keep off the grass 	49.03979469279998

 perhaps they get a man smell off us 	44.578858285938765

 what though 	603.247603307688

 cigary gloves long john had on his desk the other day 	32.088802133006865

 what you eat and drink gives that 	25.937577267279206

 mansmell i mean 	164.61298710274278

 must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different 	21.875173663857844

 railed off the altar get on to it at any cost 	51.55314721510397

 the tree of forbidden priest 	28.09685553357495

 o father will you 	60.401891962870735

 let me be the first to 	48.6116270449903

 that diffuses itself all through the body permeates 	27.250889322254636

 source of life 	163.405870565216

 and it’s extremely curious the smell 	27.584205498479772

 celery sauce 	1034.7682763620928

 let me 	151.28351270668938

 mr bloom inserted his nose 	40.76870205608258

 into the 	86.30109151377859

 opening of his waistcoat 	143.30246467583987

 almonds or 	730.502707563702

 lemons it is 	161.54616534607402

 ah no that’s the soap 	45.28543019143975

 o by the by that lotion 	69.62956130006904

 i knew there was something on my mind 	44.54080216645601

 never went back and the soap not paid 	43.92120488285463

 dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning 	27.40398081694942

 hynes might have paid me that three shillings 	34.44423897842829

 i could mention meagher’s just to remind him 	27.111834888114593

 still if he works that paragraph 	54.903858727934775

 two and nine 	83.37520624743941

 bad opinion of me he’ll have 	43.660668255393176

 call tomorrow 	427.19535094289114

 how much do i owe you 	40.0438564735721

 three and nine 	122.80115110056636

 two and nine sir 	61.38896671339968

 might stop him giving credit another time 	18.973814825514918

 lose your customers that way 	27.091548359734947

 pubs do 	754.9735493636557

 fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else 	20.44831557337174

 here’s this nobleman passed before 	28.715976949449782

 just went as far as turn back 	27.26670435973995

 always at home at dinnertime 	57.56897270749244

 looks mangled out had a good tuck in 	26.694359510123007

 enjoying nature now 	133.78620857224334

 grace after meals 	77.83941851745088

 after supper walk a mile 	26.750193456191706

 sure he has a small bank balance somewhere government sit 	20.644710361115834

 walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today 	22.07443077560768

 still you learn something 	68.40729515910868

 see ourselves as others see us 	18.702337745792796

 so long as women don’t mock what matter 	21.939245131066208

 that’s the way to find out 	25.506276146501577

 ask yourself who is he now 	44.3247614068591

 the mystery man on the beach prize titbit story by mr leopold bloom 	16.278088998223605

 payment at the rate of one guinea per column 	25.80264956490709

 and that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh 	35.58304642150078

 corns on his kismet however 	71.78165658043564

 healthy perhaps absorb all the 	27.06056365299032

 whistle brings rain they say 	27.92281611798451

 must be some somewhere 	74.2387157023741

 salt in the ormond damp 	117.99728926623169

 the body feels the atmosphere 	39.79529286343161

 old betty’s joints are on the rack 	39.64812060386872

 mother shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling 	23.086860308675437

 signs of rain it is 	47.705061183532216

 the royal reader 	131.18326291151453

 grace darling 	447.2111489749867

 people afraid of the dark 	71.1891484245472

 also glowworms cyclists lightingup time 	21.72465770106901

 jewels diamonds flash better 	52.40360961435436

 light is a kind of reassuring 	59.39283750695493

 not going to hurt you 	51.60058092796591

 better now of course than long ago 	36.35980663435005

 country roads 	286.73876236441674

 run you through the small guts for nothing 	25.174308287150083

 still two types there are you bob against 	29.4564201218817

 scowl or smile 	165.95470916667333

 pardon not at all 	50.88488890646642

 best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun 	26.975350875771593

 some light still 	86.1715879783172

 red rays are longest 	39.04229750459907

 roygbiv vance taught us red orange yellow green blue indigo violet 	10.746650384346978

 a star i see 	44.1164430044024

 can’t tell yet 	45.117852873998366

 when three it’s night 	45.02627895533414

 were those nightclouds there all the time 	18.468018645627566

 trees are they 	72.85968417387701

 an optical illusion 	78.48566950904244

 land of the setting sun this 	47.47730527120037

 homerule sun setting in the southeast 	77.99349897960398

 dew falling 	579.6893936061301

 bad for you dear to sit on that stone 	41.96854746690756

 brings on white fluxions 	53.28815725033638

 never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through 	15.735064504564319

 might get piles myself 	50.366162544395394

 sticks too like a summer cold sore on the mouth 	31.876810161617943

 friction of the position 	303.1357680085324

 like to be that rock she sat on 	24.290109379749715

 o sweet little you don’t know how nice you looked 	16.69805172874031

 i begin to like them at that age 	37.64809932180902

 grab at all that offer 	123.35559477953866

 suppose it’s the only time we cross legs seated 	21.82546454892982

 also the library today those girl graduates 	23.0347213556077

 happy chairs under them 	34.752394762278904

 but it’s the evening influence 	45.57153344075403

 they feel all that 	77.92281936070567

 open like flowers know their hours sunflowers jerusalem artichokes in ballrooms chandeliers avenues under the lamps 	7.889473295770291

 nightstock in mat dillon’s garden where i kissed her shoulder 	21.92864920615246

 wish i had a full length oilpainting of her then 	29.653829439580427

 june that was too i wooed 	65.32264317792345

 the year returns 	136.67877387631742

 history repeats itself 	82.3233236404359

 ye crags and peaks i’m with you once again 	17.514796426514316

 and now 	130.96017151444227

 they take advantage 	142.2472107526928

 all quiet on howth now 	34.851052739299305

 the distant hills seem 	46.408573251451074

 where we 	438.860078308159

 the rhododendrons 	372.57333741205076

 i am a fool perhaps 	43.24002337624766

 he gets the plums and i the plumstones 	27.536627238160307

 where i come in 	79.71850317139777

 all that old hill has seen 	35.90527970729318

 names change that’s all 	32.365116149798965

 lovers yum yum 	85.32881365207552

 she kissed me 	85.61797091240354

 never again 	445.9529054251866

 my youth 	478.21042555093936

 only once it comes 	49.57183541120696

 or hers 	359.875283479143

 take the train there tomorrow 	43.51064621694273

 returning not the same 	79.07331016514749

 like kids your second visit to a house 	21.98594717515067

 nothing new under the sun 	50.30422988154136

 care of <initial> <initial> dolphin’s barn 	37.76876595510166

 are you not happy in your 	19.851171598940653

 naughty darling 	498.2696427007718

 at dolphin’s barn charades in luke doyle’s house 	16.733313371463176

 mat dillon and his bevy of daughters tiny atty floey maimy louy hetty 	11.108414445381582

 molly too 	738.189631637398

 eightyseven that was 	161.20758032689412

 year before we 	75.64029171130468

 and the old major partial to his drop of spirits 	23.787128823265512

 curious she an only child i an only child 	15.909738757459087

 so it returns 	152.46113145506354

 think you’re escaping and run into yourself 	22.01818775821814

 longest way round is the shortest way home 	26.90114829553077

 and just when he and she 	45.69301864251528

 circus horse walking in a ring 	64.37006925329015

 rip van winkle we played 	31.311827487295172

 rip tear in henny doyle’s overcoat 	33.842384323643905

 van breadvan delivering 	73.41488035362632

 winkle cockles and periwinkles 	52.99351507299299

 she leaned on the sideboard watching 	60.316648732159045

 moorish eyes 	579.181018822868

 twenty years asleep in sleepy hollow 	25.104629888494877

 his gun rusty from the dew 	46.942523598397344

 what is that flying about 	53.04475003479939

 bat probably 	579.6069603528232

 thinks i’m a tree so blind 	30.469444763016217

 have birds no smell 	37.137431159093815

 they believed you could be changed into a tree from grief 	23.49121094052836

 weeping willow 	487.9283942655099

 there he goes 	77.4433504315615

 funny little beggar 	162.0207004745448

 wonder where he lives 	123.67069087664832

 belfry up there 	145.75494309844746

 very likely 	396.63290256201424

 hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity 	50.24446032565826

 bell scared him out i suppose 	27.269032282750434

 mass seems to be over 	64.50654609575402

 could hear them all at it 	50.799347854309865

 pray for us 	61.95576357115642

 and pray for us 	31.552913955364136

 and pray for us 	31.552913955364136

 good idea the repetition 	49.31311853211958

 same thing with ads 	62.523997964870794

 buy from us 	99.4933188428133

 and buy from us 	38.4151673268091

 yes there’s the light in the priest’s house 	40.80549360386143

 their frugal meal 	58.626458899040536

 remember about the mistake in the valuation when i was in thom’ <initial> twentyeight it is 	26.47357905247335

 two houses they have 	44.08236276572886

 wonder why they come out at night like mice 	38.805639772921445

 they’re a mixed breed 	34.60318993482646

 what frightens them light or noise 	20.820721959566956

 better sit still 	124.10307258765454

 all instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles 	17.351758269225563

 like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands 	36.06343601734092

 weeny bones 	863.1170699095595

 almost see them shimmering kind of a bluey white 	32.59108951272467

 colours depend on the light you see 	46.78318583817074

 stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish 	17.32018798492597

 wants to stamp his trademark on everything 	18.56396432715271

 instance that cat this morning on the staircase 	36.97466862407431

 colour of brown turf 	77.95026513372432

 say you never see them with three colours 	48.304375584653016

 not true 	407.63215394173506

 that half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the city arms with the letter em on her forehead 	23.233489796607035

 body fifty different colours 	35.66216712385322

 howth a while ago amethyst 	36.83846360920758

 glass flashing 	404.67063746911117

 that’s how that wise man what’s his name with the burning glass 	19.103056270024616

 then the heather goes on fire 	29.81094033217794

 it can’t be tourists’ matches 	24.681344697424084

 perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light 	21.373754111745498

 or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun 	25.435088769096268

 i have it my memory’s not so bad 	35.37646612048784

 who knows what they’re always flying for 	32.37743093906002

 that bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling 	30.663228017665595

 on her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered 	8.70663948389521

 glad after she was that ere adread was 	33.01888572852207

 her he asked if o’hare doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that o’hare doctor in heaven was 	11.052707967730107

 sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful 	23.980990093156297

 all she there told him ruing death for friend so young algate sore unwilling god’s rightwiseness to withsay 	10.484557974654253

 she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his goodness with masspriest to be shriven holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs 	14.587781622334406

 the man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in mona island through bellycrab three year agone come childermas and she prayed to god the allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness 	13.115527783488469

 he heard her sad words in held hat sad staring 	13.857360811045226

 therefore everyman look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came 	18.089082253685135

 the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed 	28.42862276644977

 the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be 	18.9798697997981

 then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house 	22.762798904239407

 the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid 	18.62828055159594

 nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless 	16.127096996461706

 and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon 	24.414834040686188

 and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there 	26.330403517252922

 and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile 	19.548052856570948

 also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility 	16.00375299222549

 but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle 	14.24848114282559

 and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery 	9.664605625227882

 and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment 	13.77840192310547

 and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously 	11.56337900052772

 and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles 	19.55027671844679

 and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer 	10.4230803522651

 and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so 	9.526589814792024

 and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress 	15.711297865293679

 and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain 	14.213849985962074

 and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead 	14.060343512829668

 and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each 	8.506037556800722

 and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile 	12.12731866038994

 and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile 	25.056892462531586

 thanked be almighty god 	45.516533935827255

 this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast 	9.260237925992556

 sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now 	17.825763774642944

 meseems it dureth overlong 	54.058535925666135

 and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently 	15.669503025978367

 but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long 	13.303717181257008

 and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next 	15.753787177023893

 also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness 	18.1156455870006

 and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup 	12.138989744843855

 woman’s woe with wonder pondering 	33.24137226955041

 now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might 	26.72214580075097

 there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable’s with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold 	10.754366018089812

 but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow 	20.166850445899943

 and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner 	15.194047937813737

 ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave 	14.292509514026884

 for they were right witty scholars 	34.74611030408319

 and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case  	11.0941831956501

 and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die 	13.878690274368902

 and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy 	11.986905484114336

 a redress god grant 	34.54639190702209

 this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die 	13.770515119139331

 in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack 	9.928994115636398

 then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved 	11.777650539885558

 to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk 	9.229538588606621

 both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire 	10.884441730396293

 but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of life 	12.328369409246713

 for sirs he said our lust is brief 	21.736149303567366

 we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we 	10.560034468419305

 then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends 	11.400902190301354

 but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead 	18.36748793424372

 whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do 	10.837085696859825

 thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever 	14.610381232751697

 then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides 	9.155653837157628

 he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded 	10.117460986802667

 all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life 	10.64417260356548

 a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions 	10.886363439588692

 that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word 	10.776561251835012

 which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons 	22.635929353974504

 but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny 	11.826383712413765

 and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores 	13.536114142556459

 about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray 	10.252871063467321

 now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment 	14.720902999406029

 leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone 	18.395499212525678

 be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay 	15.540380763423782

 see ye here 	90.0131092322922

 and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ 	15.831332595651741

 they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore 	14.48041178362668

 his words were then these as followeth know all men he said time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions 	18.08017781946605

 what means this 	130.21813988586388

 desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time 	15.179529962065638

 but here is the matter now 	74.80416992948534

 or she knew him that second i say and was but creature of her creature vergine madre figlia di tuo figlio or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with peter piscator who lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages parceque <initial> léo taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon ventre de dieu entweder transubstantiality oder consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality 	7.950267051329354

 and all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word 	25.55712718332159

 a pregnancy without joy he said a birth without pangs a body without blemish a belly without bigness 	9.792312443228283

 hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch staboo stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack the first three months she was not well staboo when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard 	10.372672588757672

 it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him a murrain seize the dolt what a devil he would be at thou chuff thou puny thou got in peasestraw thou losel thou chitterling thou spawn of a rebel thou dykedropt thou abortion thou to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet margerain gentle advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred 	8.814846842699941

 in horne’s house rest should reign 	23.86850789905968

 to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles goodly grinning asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days 	12.70550488531137

 master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership 	13.044677869145541

 but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin 	20.961379031952763

 thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided 	9.247824460242013

 he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their maid’s tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers to bed to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals 	13.119759817111094

 young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it 	17.116722196048613

 and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm 	13.671303744434868

 then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour 	14.378787638114854

 but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead 	17.039011320535852

 but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne’s hall 	12.784685700769892

 he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the braggart’s side spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon 	13.760082301891597

 but was young boasthard’s fear vanquished by calmer’s words 	20.915544411818313

 no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away 	18.194694366100812

 and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other 	22.396653669720507

 he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either 	36.846637057044305

 but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal 	22.297284515538642

 indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle 	26.049963653143227

 heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon 	16.12221057734866

 why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done  	23.248087294567124

 for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show 	19.8536043836828

 by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law 	14.535416539463782

 then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe on me that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it 	13.066167592464726

 yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is bird in the hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two in the bush or by some learned carnal concupiscence 	17.196908754889154

 this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird in the hand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her 	13.679839814883284

 for regarding believe on me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first two in the bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild 	10.876559044691017

 so were they all in their blind fancy mr cavil and mr sometimes godly mr ape swillale mr false franklin mr dainty dixon young boasthard and mr cautious calmer 	9.271288830803162

 wherein o wretched company were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth 	13.727173013013598

 but by and by as said this evening after sundown the wind sitting in the west biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after past ten of the clock one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came 	12.950286079043675

 bloom there for a languor he had but was now better he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame mrs moll with red slippers on in a pair of turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and mistress purefoy there that got in through pleading her belly and now on the stools poor body two days past her term the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they say but god give her soon issue 	12.690925351013611

 ’tis her ninth chick to live i hear and lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible 	15.19697207267069

 in sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of malachi’s almanac and i hear that mr russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how 	11.668564376307856

 with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk 	19.7583538682296

 he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat 	11.755473061578659

 to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies paul’s men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip 	10.65468238589898

 he took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides 	14.214479604248945

 the other costello that is hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale 	19.596478349135946

 faith no he says frank that was his name ’tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague 	20.036154901489184

 but they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it 	20.039460814883864

 there’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset 	16.884260378314995

 mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too 	16.17265607549214

 from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes 	15.722027196153242

 he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him 	12.758548721616897

 what says mr leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all 	23.625006248575584

 i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats says he 	20.208832073757765

 i can scarce believe ’tis so bad says he 	17.45911792590048

 and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street 	8.546218097666058

 i question with you there says he 	35.08460838180786

 mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns 	14.02821649882736

 come come says mr vincent plain dealing 	25.228496287479118

 he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s irish says he 	24.99739182604525

 irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop 	15.516430572059512

 i conceive you says mr dixon 	34.105650063068445

 it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose 	16.77311487883308

 true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock 	19.86456307337066

 he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains 	12.315996481502868

 what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself 	13.783422944153434

 so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly 	18.08323147022864

 but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland 	15.744129847503514

 another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content 	16.250015050354126

 by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture 	20.215945752953402

 to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him 	10.675375354345842

 ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground 	19.844538175338528

 and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry’s orders 	12.639740404145941

 there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i’ll meddle in his matters says he 	17.552459423059574

 i’ll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me 	15.626319827533434

 but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show 	14.098703241199779

 after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name 	21.213163868880795

 then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat 	14.726717489031302

 in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt 	19.880039265168897

 they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america 	9.319346786611744

 which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty —pope peter’s but a pissabed 	19.942200524118547

 a man’s a man for a’ that 	31.580016376946478

 our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars 	13.46092874004734

 mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on 	23.571517753170184

 whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan 	12.345079165939847

 fertiliser and incubator 	164.96151647063502

 lambay island  	731.6736437330759

 his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed 	12.065628314748292

 well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon 	25.537692711008706

 i make no doubt it smacks of wenching 	18.558138923048496

 come be seated both 	56.401388598142226

 ’tis as cheap sitting as standing 	9.42905461805209

 it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep 	8.801038320801291

 to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party 	6.653594405857622

 he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural 	11.604961417590552

 money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains 	29.489728854690952

 the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man 	9.591760544395676

 for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies 	8.430613777650333

 after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it 	13.714119718401506

 they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald 	16.366159650307214

 his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle 	11.360567034085246

 mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck 	6.563242089196956

 valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced 	13.977911766069932

 the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour 	14.61373827874017

 mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give 	11.805147229167549

 who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of horne’s house that was in an interesting condition poor body from woman’s woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place 	10.777313345395298

 mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach 	11.132726029470614

 for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop there’s a belly that never bore a bastard 	10.54931184997501

 this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight 	12.418370481905818

 the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber 	17.472603937346328

 here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it 	12.050338619811871

 mais bien sûr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments  	12.35506050917018

 that you may and very opportunely 	49.26199232073497

 there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity 	16.846417075059186

 but gracious heaven was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my god i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things 	17.857188210163603

 with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein 	11.204423402311726

 gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness ’pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever 	9.293857500875403

 i declare i was never so touched in all my life 	26.29870030995825

 god i thank thee as the author of my days thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours 	12.32325339547931

 a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again 	11.90538702848199

 beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years 	9.907121003470428

 but indeed sir i wander from the point 	33.96094190582187

 how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys 	18.88381594878383

 maledicity he exclaimed in anguish 	44.98755425220679

 would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along i could weep to think of it 	14.609280180165163

 then though it had poured seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse 	19.08105548679094

 but beshrew me he cried clapping hand to his forehead tomorrow will be a new day and thousand thunders i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting 	13.677641013793341

 tut tut cries le fécondateur tripping in my friend monsieur moore that most accomplished traveller i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any even the stoutest cloak 	11.334726847083067

 a drenching of that violence he tells me sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world 	8.889291082420186

 pooh a livre cries monsieur lynch 	23.614802195758063

 the clumsy things are dear at a sou 	22.31045459321892

 one umbrella were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom is worth ten such stopgaps 	10.422526127326606

 no woman of any wit would wear one 	28.009662155706568

 my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment 	10.637729835602336

 but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge 	13.939432388360197

 amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company 	14.408186045060125

 the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry 	11.107436420369535

 strike me silly said costello a low fellow who was fuddled 	17.96916699874985

 a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh i’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you 	13.934661293175768

 what you dog 	169.140758956612

 have you a way with them 	46.360508129737475

 gad’s bud immensely so said mr lynch 	30.41320897017072

 the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice 	33.57405747869008

 demme does not doctor o’gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin 	18.93286446120821

 as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months 	19.33638215860116

 lawksamercy doctor cried the young blood in the primrose vest feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body how you do tease a body drat the man bless me i’m all of a wibbly wobbly 	14.228585451348724

 why you’re as bad as dear little father cantekissem that you are may this pot of four half choke me cried costello if she aint in the family way 	13.924477329753454

 i knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her 	22.648015312491424

 the young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward 	16.684020162730498

 merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy 	21.26347140139664

 i want patience said he with those who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct revile an ennobling profession which saving the reverence due to the deity is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth 	9.95655384393992

 i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which so far from being a byword should be a glorious incentive in the human breast 	17.065916260139858

 i cannot away with them 	47.635786570766406

 and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay 	14.336511002368608

 perish the thought i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne 	13.660916259003788

 having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door 	15.538533112068446

 a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath 	9.959514093944726

 stap my vitals said he them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart 	15.044863833163488

 to revert to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity 	13.423093420257334

 the young sparks it is true were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf 	8.12401776710488

 but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin 	14.669070550205866

 it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and by intercepting them with the readiest precaution foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable 	10.072233594216353

 not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe is ever as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions 	12.646077012127039

 to conclude while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was however it must be owned not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being 	17.281536986064367

 accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his notion of the thing his opinion who ought not perchance to express one was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers 	15.047686910287817

 the dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron 	16.11566937784658

 i must acquaint you said mr crotthers clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis old glory allelujurum was round again today an elderly man with dundrearies preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina my life as he calls her 	10.084922092342973

 i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon 	17.68674003146794

 ’slife i’ll be round with you 	15.679497436765939

 i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her 	11.393087946864219

 all fell to praising of it each after his own fashion though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household 	10.70882619538271

 singular communed the guest with himself the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest 	7.93326270209308

 but he further added it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together 	13.24453585720841

 where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled 	19.575048187889653

 during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents 	12.557010372048786

 has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received 	16.289358328419137

 or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is if report belie him not his own and his only enjoyer 	18.197740659846378

 far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady the daughter of a gallant major or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done then be it so 	13.76492415286003

 unhappy woman she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate 	13.888349126077674

 he says this a censor of morals a very pelican in his piety who did not scruple oblivious of the ties of nature to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society nay had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with hagar the egyptian in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic 	11.471069035900262

 it ill becomes him to preach that gospel 	26.14943360498584

 has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare 	19.357481541922166

 a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life 	11.123033104346616

 if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him 	6.130419936896339

 his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce 	10.853345654736424

 the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which when rooted in its native orient throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but transplanted to a clime more temperate its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant acid and inoperative 	7.572318379074199

 the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born 	14.568113202225137

 when he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier broke out at once into a strife of tongues 	11.27496427269327

 in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge to mollify to refrain 	10.99211528934413

 the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent 	13.950212877765752

 every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers the caesarean section posthumity with respect to the father and that rarer form with respect to the mother the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets miscarriages and infanticides simulated or dissimulated the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen cited by mr candidate mulligan in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that as he said one ear could hear what the other spoke the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid as exemplified in the actual case with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix artificial insemination by means of syringes involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers sturzgeburt the recorded instances of multiseminal twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations 	8.085513494002456

 the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest by her movement the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning ardently and ineffectually entertained to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation 	10.904958494168707

 the abnormalities of harelip breastmole supernumerary digits negro’s inkle strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten or doghaired infants occasionally born 	7.510254360514231

 the hypothesis of a plasmic memory advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human 	12.044794198844402

 an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views with such heat as almost carried conviction the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses 	11.171694456095874

 the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived 	20.980560074963496

 it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man 	10.556163796780423

 contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus 	7.143231026855385

 hitherto silent whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice he delivered briefly and as some thought perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined 	10.477757819352954

 but malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror 	19.387927541372683

 he conjured up the scene before them 	41.411908740972116

 the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared 	22.466959762593685

 haines which of us did not feel his flesh creep he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand in the other a phial marked poison 	17.62693052231739

 surprise horror loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin 	15.15100566792789

 i anticipated some such reception he began with an eldritch laugh for which it seems history is to blame 	13.37743770553188

 yes it is true 	88.42470844938644

 i am the murderer of samuel childs 	17.51182791780632

 tare and ages what way would i be resting at all he muttered thickly and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus 	14.331158208230615

 dope is my only hope 	61.39286447954699

 ah destruction the black panther with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back 	19.032102790499597

 an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven 	15.72514621055768

 he was gone 	121.78050756590137

 tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host 	45.67313646416897

 the seer raised his hand to heaven murmuring the vendetta of mananaun the sage repeated lex talionis  	10.311787707751314

 the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done 	12.694274583101413

 malachias overcome by emotion ceased 	32.17540225986394

 the mystery was unveiled 	44.11973066373939

 haines was the third brother 	103.50089130451208

 his real name was childs 	42.773607798305136

 the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father 	24.283023034527655

 no longer is leopold as he sits there ruminating chewing the cud of reminiscence that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds 	11.29475154462047

 a score of years are blown away 	23.86669620685415

 or it is the same figure a year or so gone over in his first hard hat ah that was a day already on the road a fullfledged traveller for the family firm equipped with an orderbook a scented handkerchief not for show only his case of bright trinketware alas a thing now of the past and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin shyly acknowledging but the heart 	12.775782099972597

 but hey presto the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes shrivels dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist 	14.281602286513797

 now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons 	24.646749550891514

 how serene does she now arise a queen among the pleiades in the penultimate antelucan hour shod in sandals of bright gold coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer 	11.664168071078661

 it floats it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams emerald sapphire mauve and heliotrope sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind winding coiling simply swirling writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol it blazes alpha a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus 	7.2678891547766735

 who supposes it 	85.73931831520771

 i bous stephanoumenos bullockbefriending bard am lord and giver of their life 	13.837025449290378

 he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves smiling at vincent 	11.62125821105639

 that answer and those leaves vincent said to him will adorn you more fitly when something more and greatly more than a capful of light odes can call your genius father 	9.309212943808095

 all who wish you well hope this for you 	16.77513877543845

 all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate to acclaim you stephaneforos 	15.226975576046783

 i heartily wish you may not fail them 	26.277188489937124

 o no vincent lenehan said laying a hand on the shoulder near him 	23.93563801582028

 have no fear 	143.04654991868904

 he could not leave his mother an orphan 	30.862976374328934

 the young man’s face grew dark 	28.038692206301643

 all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss 	30.67413068666554

 he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart 	20.134325944470415

 madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name lenehan as much more 	18.969654960135856

 he told them of the race 	69.21431783482045

 the flag fell and huuh off scamper the mare ran out freshly with <initial> madden up 	8.855022526902397

 she was leading the field 	37.42904839629677

 all hearts were beating 	51.41300088074777

 even phyllis could not contain herself 	33.71061182260564

 she waved her scarf and cried huzzah sceptre wins but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level reached outstripped her 	11.6562312138276

 all was lost now 	64.53953085797599

 phyllis was silent her eyes were sad anemones 	33.42313832702435

 juno she cried i am undone 	65.1446946688851

 but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook 	14.377595602681366

 a tear fell one only 	33.184416299315636

 a whacking fine whip said lenehan is <initial> lane 	12.181763868275443

 four winners yesterday and three today 	27.168914513075897

 what rider is like him 	42.73125604820875

 mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his 	15.848510305661888

 but let us bear it as was the ancient wont 	41.85603343393105

 mercy on the luckless poor sceptre he said with a light sigh 	35.40348185452155

 she is not the filly that she was 	26.62179397351106

 never by this hand shall we behold such another 	17.431622485786455

 by gad sir a queen of them 	19.15098040328943

 do you remember her vincent 	39.43666513933692

 i wish you could have seen my queen today vincent said 	20.25674779236586

 how young she was and radiant lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it 	14.126433311792823

 in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge 	11.302562537977987

 but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close 	23.411780684316057

 a week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril 	12.018212780863365

 she is more taking then 	41.14182401150018

 her posies too mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together 	13.883364545249194

 and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field 	18.752560343151593

 conmee himself he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page 	14.252205501727138

 when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries 	16.290902469320148

 but he had been kind 	75.92584112854156

 in going by he had blessed us 	42.499308374163185

 the gods too are ever kind lenehan said 	16.139187302891546

 if i had poor luck with bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely 	16.230428781584767

 he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label 	17.73246925191164

 warily malachi whispered preserve a druid silence 	15.431416997157546

 his soul is far away 	48.227796661263135

 it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born 	24.9699697848026

 any object intensely regarded may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods 	19.811020409699992

 do you not think it stephen 	47.16038933633434

 theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law 	15.468324025143115

 however as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all 	15.687541890286704

 the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop 	9.552182827605293

 during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton on trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance 	11.81807511009164

 he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn 	12.510664548518372

 the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life 	15.200467253292954

 neither place nor council was lacking in dignity 	12.536682088339974

 the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital 	20.313198809968096

 the high hall of horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic 	13.442636275836291

 a gallant scene in truth it made 	18.71561620273115

 crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway 	22.600417610547048

 there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom 	9.392038426488657

 next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden 	10.936960415190372

 the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan 	8.86648360671464

 lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come 	8.558469444895787

 it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr <initial> dedalus’ div 	19.553401477150082

 contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods 	9.08061936850213

 science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena 	11.262977601734782

 the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can 	12.513163507502517

 there may be it is true some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by mr <initial> bloom pubb 	15.326969423550745

 regarding the future determination of sex 	27.91425938433366

 must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both 	6.9117300978800795

 the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality 	14.27933270205916

 it is interesting because as he pertinently remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways 	18.105513709580382

 mr <initial> mulligan hyg 	62.141224452232976

 et eug 	589.93277528509

 blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids pulmonary complaints etc 	9.323392465500005

 by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust 	10.912586071580993

 these factors he alleged and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets hideous publicity posters religious ministers of all denominations mutilated soldiers and sailors exposed scorbutic cardrivers the suspended carcases of dead animals paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these he said were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race 	7.427630626057328

 kalipedia he prophesied would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life genuinely good music agreeable literature light philosophy instructive pictures plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo artistic coloured photographs of prize babies all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner 	8.899557234326462

 mr <initial> crotthers disc 	59.951147125823454

 attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide 	10.06608579924773

 although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative 	11.619224377126688

 in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions 	14.492084682531559

 an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr <initial> lynch bacc 	20.40060459011937

 that both natality and mortality as well as all other phenomena of evolution tidal movements lunar phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in fine in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained 	9.88599246566647

 still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poet’s words give us pause 	10.057679425761899

 nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest 	9.403343650314858

 mr <initial> dedalus’ div 	41.18710044457909

 remark or should it be called an interruption 	20.967414269863784

 that an omnivorous being which can masticate deglute digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition corpulent professional gentlemen not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to 	6.070811800683303

 for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother 	8.308915141289987

 in a recent public controversy with mr <initial> bloom pubb 	19.43079979890311

 which took place in the commons’ hall of the national maternity hospital <number> <number> and <number> holles street of which as is well known dr <initial> horne lic 	15.1494256490882

 <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> <initial> is the able and popular master he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag an esthete’s allusion presumably to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress she must let it out again or give it life as he phrased it to save her own 	14.034206941598685

 at the risk of her own was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered 	17.63966643904157

 meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy accouchement 	17.66342215469127

 it had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor 	13.412699539717128

 all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped 	14.99866162459431

 she had 	119.34098550267504

 she had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy 	24.235660608911193

 those who have passed on who have gone before are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene 	15.618941414086935

 reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes that longing hunger for baby fingers a pretty sight it is to see in the first bloom of her new motherhood breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to one above the universal husband 	16.25475211096988

 and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy to lay in his arms that mite of god’s clay the fruit of their lawful embraces 	11.956681925501837

 he is older now you and i may whisper it and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the ulster bank college green branch 	17.64790675038424

 no let no sigh break from that bosom dear gentle mina 	12.260629746802369

 and doady knock the ashes from your pipe the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you may it be the distant day and dout the light whereby you read in the sacred book for the oil too has run low and so with a tranquil heart to bed to rest 	11.651760071301487

 he knows and will call in his own good time 	29.43492653023023

 you too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part 	14.767334061000987

 sir to you my hand 	61.04480444000972

 well done thou good and faithful servant there are sins or let us call them as the world calls them evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait 	15.588012464098037

 he may suffer their memory to grow dim let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise 	15.323320667808659

 yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances a vision or a dream or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with wine 	13.296270068047427

 not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past silent remote reproachful 	13.916044018257553

 the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there imposed as it seemed by habit or some studied trick upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness a flair for the cruder things of life 	10.972794132436356

 a scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory evoked it would seem by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there as some thought with their immediate pleasures 	14.053908885770904

 a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown purple and white fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop one by its fellow with a brief alert shock 	9.965767289918565

 and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood floey atty tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then our lady of the cherries a comely brace of them pendent from an ear bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit 	11.220363861678345

 providential you came on the scene 	61.27714099555407

 corny kelleher laughs pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding 	23.066394268945974

 two commercials that were standing fizz in jammet’ <initial> like princes faith 	13.338112532356545

 one of them lost two quid on the race 	35.22310836952268

 stephen prone breathes to the stars 	54.957916674491926

 corny kelleher asquint drawls at the horse 	29.157667104287185

 bloom in gloom looms down 	31.461913052086963

 corny kelleher scratches his nape 	29.50171790470267

 sandycove he bends down and calls to stephen 	30.87347909789991

 i’ve a rendezvous in the morning 	21.546015137367576

 burying the dead 	154.41320481751697

 bloom good night 	116.1726747500443

 i’ll just wait and take him along in a few 	23.715019273666623

 corny kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it 	28.1315382448499

 the horse harness jingles 	43.81854258331252

 corny kelleher from the car standing 	67.78373733559758

 bloom night 	635.0356487110582

 the jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly 	11.505112018563656

 the car and horse back slowly awkwardly and turn 	14.065554746378979

 corny kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at bloom’s plight 	19.39300372133171

 the jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat 	19.89986447084875

 with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done 	12.694388179507216

 with a slow nod bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs 	12.394566391696385

 the car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane 	23.284916037872467

 corny kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand 	24.601113936903953

 the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay 	9.03850370818925

 bloom holding in his hand stephen’s hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute 	19.275764539748575

 then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder 	35.640114505354866

 bloom eh ho there is no answer 	27.67170592158205

 he bends again 	84.80181843680933

 mr dedalus there is no answer 	37.494444215114584

 the name if you call 	72.74176616220339

 he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form 	22.71207950223034

 stephen there is no answer 	54.03617287118682

 he calls again 	130.05455175921733

 stephen stephen groans 	135.6321832039533

 black panther 	308.5294153652602

 he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels 	10.428945458731892

 fergus now and pierce 	114.84239123010096

 he turns on his left side sighing doubling himself together 	20.588330490464656

 well educated 	629.5338048383509

 he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen’s waistcoat 	21.71123633955579

 to breathe 	219.30949001615576

 he brushes the woodshavings from stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers 	14.604377827496236

 one pound seven 	80.82348846383985

 not hurt anyhow 	91.41051553039688

 he listens 	682.5664164823048

 the woods  	406.09552969150604

 white breast 	224.1430207272815

 dim sea 	568.4942950650087

 he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body 	21.45118708716118

 bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect 	28.276816749700906

 a dog barks in the distance 	59.45053104676539

 bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant 	21.425165426329826

 he looks down on stephen’s face and form 	35.92937813143926

 bloom communes with the night 	67.19733693647039

 face reminds me of his poor mother 	33.70789238483953

 the deep white breast 	53.08525261608368

 ferguson i think i caught 	69.49871020145757

 a girl 	199.78178977900066

 some girl 	361.4117786170229

 best thing could happen him 	28.040527343505477

 he murmurs 	342.5283915481741

 swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts 	11.34034004649215

 he murmurs 	342.5283915481741

 in the rough sands of the sea 	39.99432535371965

 a cabletow’s length from the shore 	49.873065949904856

 where the tide ebbs 	88.57675055346618

 and flows  	375.42783586525184

 silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master 	16.80104262730601

 against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand 	11.742965897038541

 he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page 	13.83723904270937

 bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly 	45.45084115817793

 rudy rudy gazes unseeing into bloom’s eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling 	14.757489185841063

 he has a delicate mauve face 	30.896153187437328

 on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons 	22.626798090175956

 in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot 	17.256976629801503

 a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket 	23.20663390697983

 — iii — <number> preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed 	12.852694200756716

 his stephen’s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabman’s shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral 	13.086730064785131

 but how to get there was the rub 	62.55423481261591

 for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned 	11.55813829273318

 so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being <initial> <initial> ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found 	18.30618760919426

 accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’ <initial> but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice 	11.652408147871508

 this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did 	18.21632034378998

 so bevelling around by mullett’s and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance 	14.184320530232714

 so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey 	10.722849853868155

 as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back 	14.627336389841572

 they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station 	9.679481480263894

 between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke’s city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable 	11.731560349291371

 bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourke’s the baker’s it is said 	14.249108647217025

 en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out 	12.200371937666457

 highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about 	13.422032138033995

 the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot 	12.9138713708367

 never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes 	13.954331720409145

 another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything 	8.780146574767093

 you frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of £ 	14.144447762680018

 <initial> <initial> into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically 	10.666983781239745

 most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs 	17.910704293119228

 —and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind 	21.117338245853286

 discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps 	12.176722257310958

 stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox 	16.368678109909585

 he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s gumley 	15.788201777036518

 to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge 	24.26214528410703

 —someone saluted you mr bloom said 	22.746359341015687

 a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling —night stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment 	11.399235988202513

 mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least 	10.831989931507051

 though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted 	9.839165606631662

 stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice 	15.940602261295922

 lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise 	21.648769781957824

 he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer 	15.093109655020452

 his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot 	11.822653091193008

 rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen 	11.726422222538064

 this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley 	9.445432775049875

 taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell 	15.1114307297141

 not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings 	28.548524065836265

 his friends had all deserted him 	22.645069418067784

 furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions 	21.883141378134273

 he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something anything at all to do 	18.773775278321306

 no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish 	18.714073713861687

 anyhow he was all in 	90.08619335946823

 —i wouldn’t ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows i’m on the rocks 	16.51669785106535

 —there’ll be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher 	20.46292482064957

 mr garrett deasy 	75.77729154958878

 try it 	245.82019016770633

 you may mention my name 	30.65450242218621

 —ah god corley replied sure i couldn’t teach in a school man 	18.58896632113802

 i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh 	29.449553759817576

 i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers 	38.846285052921104

 —i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him 	18.277173685538727

 corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street 	19.566845558948916

 there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloney’s but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m’conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob 	13.116615802037831

 he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it 	19.26031942320233

 though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence 	15.774859732890903

 however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished 	12.970425708054353

 but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful 	20.153804108048757

 he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing 	16.062640427416138

 a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation 	36.046153036267505

 he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact 	16.076913907463936

 he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect 	13.611686985155092

 about biscuits he dimly remembered 	16.84184342507171

 who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy 	19.865609853025752

 however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out 	17.01796385792339

 —those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him 	14.900026615343535

 and so in point of fact they turned out to be 	19.840841387298447

 stephen anyhow lent him one of them 	35.72421476306857

 —thanks corley answered you’re a gentleman 	21.32850639682109

 i’ll pay you back one time 	17.407571519090972

 who’s that with you 	41.315515140312115

 i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker 	20.405994598092477

 you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there 	27.179437316141563

 i’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks man 	22.69891809604782

 god you’ve to book ahead man you’d think it was for the carl rosa 	22.826176258360377

 i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper 	16.78536320474799

 subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam’s the shipchandler’s bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with o’mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe 	18.544036998780737

 anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable 	16.895484725367584

 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept 	12.488689278059846

 he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when 	14.203246731205706

 being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity 	10.84613775529744

 palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether 	18.468724558526205

 in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning 	16.437569776321965

 pretty thick that was certainly 	67.02145480282772

 the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite 	21.655880772243137

 alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is —he is down on his luck 	36.830297238019

 he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman 	21.146431847892487

 at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively —everybody gets their own ration of luck they say 	12.058638568601047

 now you mention it his face was familiar to me 	22.374241817452436

 but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive 	21.744430544564914

 —half a crown stephen responded 	34.21296455825905

 i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere 	29.501082249782392

 —needs mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does 	15.087173705380383

 everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds 	28.468757903463715

 but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself 	24.200045777577312

 walking to sandycove is out of the question 	32.64062360994433

 and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station 	15.680864855489704

 simply fag out there for nothing 	31.98221975392137

 i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house 	13.804861201966593

 —to seek misfortune was stephen’s answer 	24.372589631831964

 —i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday 	14.991896377944798

 where does he live at present 	29.518925281601195

 i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved 	35.6162863211794

 —i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly 	34.93475457223051

 —a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one 	14.760176702115945

 he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you 	17.976062275785154

 you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did 	13.030558381170287

 there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that 	12.152155757353515

 —no mr bloom repeated again i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes 	11.376299161895707

 he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals 	14.150115261732152

 of course you didn’t notice as much as i did 	16.745698127611337

 but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object 	15.498303921955545

 he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it 	10.354569318586147

 was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple 	12.416906898308216

 —except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out 	18.885384564138622

 the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less 	11.26458200631718

 grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet 	10.332535568890446

 adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties 	10.270463042228988

 — puttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini ho ragione 	9.359605851043952

 culo rotto —intendiamoci 	60.748035158812925

 mezzo sovrano più 	102.32079740050074

 —dice lui però —mezzo 	20.18493955936926

 —farabutto mortacci sui —ma ascolta cinque la testa più 	7.933979998506832

 mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the goat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in 	12.502727206379712

 a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity 	8.26279394002954

 —now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description 	11.649335743304455

 accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly 	12.388171198775646

 the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor 	7.015308962203873

 mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious —a beautiful language 	14.082185793005431

 i mean for singing purposes 	31.861977032311202

 why do you not write your poetry in that language 	32.348717517918566

 bella poetria it is so melodious and full 	28.523886179720378

 stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied —to fill the ear of a cow elephant 	15.32724794126173

 they were haggling over money 	32.28972017766372

 —is that so 	68.60723818371079

 of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it 	7.7649115171836876

 the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête à tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed 	17.02903467242658

 after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to 	17.7313953601846

 for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him 	13.14889302379542

 —sounds are impostures stephen said after a pause of some little time like names 	19.925587228102764

 cicero podmore napoleon mr goodbody 	28.945986767334976

 jesus mr doyle 	140.14407572035995

 shakespeares were as common as murphies 	36.9291625412581

 what’s in a name 	45.62704706741318

 —yes to be sure mr bloom unaffectedly concurred 	37.57030018871469

 of course 	28.052189527552603

 our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across 	15.099897997482417

 the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking —and what might your name be 	13.210427221680776

 just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered —dedalus 	14.73243370147801

 the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water 	10.135599760437978

 —you know simon dedalus 	50.655618721732885

 he asked at length 	50.87189238780877

 —i’ve heard of him stephen said 	27.102615684391505

 mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too 	23.140154177981717

 —he’s irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding 	15.074147508529819

 all irish 	435.6447661860678

 —all too irish stephen rejoined 	23.174384609194636

 as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark —i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder 	15.692058627973811

 the lefthand dead shot 	34.0959633446342

 —bottles out there say 	55.74558376222342

 fifty yards measured 	98.04976140073

 eggs on the bottles 	169.47575436987833

 cocks his gun over his shoulder 	30.03056906665594

 ai <title> he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely 	21.78947611542852

 then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance 	13.365453135258155

 the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg 	9.007651733323483

 —pom he shouted twice 	38.728990959707026

 egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily —buffalo bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will 	6.99304285730665

 a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley 	13.650206806285258

 —beg pardon the sailor said 	29.25544459803879

 —long ago 	113.55164046256954

 mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth 	17.897394886778837

 —why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years 	15.611914921545203

 he toured the wide world with hengler’s royal circus 	19.715110413127192

 she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now sailing about 	13.29561632059904

 mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon 	12.089876580303848

 across the world for a wife 	68.67339076262675

 never about the runaway wife coming back however much devoted to the absentee 	21.68698579806075

 the face at the window judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half wrecked in his affections 	15.263653693199394

 you little expected me but i’ve come to stay and make a fresh start 	21.456578682071488

 i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband <initial> <initial> murphy 	17.992547722792825

 the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request —you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you 	19.7939693464542

 the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand 	17.485376677987887

 —thank you the sailor said 	45.60352301474109

 he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded —we come up this morning eleven o’clock 	15.719585259345406

 —you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter 	23.284912203807433

 —why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it i’ve circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on 	14.909195629812636

 i was in the red sea 	52.14983034963894

 —why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug 	13.592243916587385

 i seen queer things too ups and downs 	18.346362816287204

 i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid 	14.742615808663759

 he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously —khaan like that 	10.601062157942403

 and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses 	13.880361373900268

 here they are 	98.0289053249815

 a friend of mine sent me 	28.843292457139682

 he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table 	13.981576440768363

 the printed matter on it stated choza de indios 	19.60918036532604

 all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited a group of savage women in striped loincloths squatted blinking suckling frowning sleeping amid a swarm of infants there must have been quite a score of them outside some primitive shanties of osier 	7.844786227506916

 his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more 	8.133913760777403

 —know how to keep them off 	45.82313772922935

 he inquired generally 	102.95142113449634

 nobody volunteering a statement he winked saying —glass 	16.658389679212306

 that boggles ’em 	34.121736865476194

 mr bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark 	9.93107976348703

 it ran as follows tarjeta postal señor a boudin galeria becche santiago chile 	6.131910834048368

 there was no message evidently as he took particular notice 	24.455733785787384

 though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo don cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <initial> <initial> somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest 	11.216778710564752

 but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear purse permitting a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back 	12.973088607820083

 the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth falmouth southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with 	10.418048891508109

 another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas eastbourne scarborough margate and so on beautiful bournemouth the channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative 	8.731523410496619

 not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness mrs c p m’coy type lend me your valise and i’ll post you the ticket 	13.14153513680118

 no something top notch an all star irish caste the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure 	9.103857786932084

 but who 	463.72141081772526

 that was the rub 	63.02749882192069

 also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguard rosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally 	13.300121415038102

 a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man <initial> <initial> brown robinson and co 	10.17624492057178

 it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife 	13.74860737275152

 after all hang it they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life 	10.940833744041129

 there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow rightly termed the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup d’œil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise silken thomas grace o’malley george iv rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar 	9.787867083947452

 because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired 	17.179259639824604

 interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact 	11.293630435410591

 he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen 	22.22660737454895

 —i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different 	14.350546273668535

 one was a ship another was a house another was a flower 	39.37184619362609

 cooks rats in your soup he appetisingly added the chinks does 	13.504943105617636

 possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures 	13.276863609677944

 —and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap 	25.6171894216718

 knife in his back 	125.01977870136497

 knife like that 	102.0450923799441

 whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position 	14.19518167144289

 —in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers 	29.087968026206283

 fellow hid behind a door come up behind him 	23.726520834548378

 like that 	88.62984162214191

 prepare to meet your god says he 	31.782549852178395

 chuk it went into his back up to the butt 	55.38183473269293

 his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to 	7.812521126537574

 —that’s a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable stiletto  	13.861703217340315

 after which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors otherwise pocket 	8.722190739133882

 —they’re great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all 	22.565897303293447

 that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives 	18.2303436453158

 at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr <initial> and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skin the goat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair 	9.870909661583283

 his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on 	12.03656037770291

 funny very there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause 	14.610084918973147

 one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seaman’s discharge 	12.500752984260796

 mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood 	17.53047757319217

 —ay boss the sailor broke in 	25.338476481326154

 give us back them papers 	38.73667123667511

 the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape 	16.429568417121367

 —have you seen the rock of gibraltar 	25.755869882289602

 mr bloom inquired 	144.44430262503303

 the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no 	15.92755693083979

 —ah you’ve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn 	14.890390463396395

 —what year would that be about 	26.54655362530092

 mr b interrogated 	143.18832546357154

 can you recall the boats 	28.76572028513196

 our soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering —i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships 	13.453620176750618

 salt junk all the time 	36.95153117701611

 tired seemingly he ceased 	41.94391654967361

 his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves 	14.34213491521738

 on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings 	10.898760595273844

 and it left him wondering why 	25.910568004791905

 possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates 	16.559946096171146

 and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all 	17.398943398409482

 nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather 	12.107978557172238

 —there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month 	14.676058801429193

 them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife 	24.140991066836783

 i’m game for that job shaving and brushup 	19.796964016173305

 i hate roaming about 	45.48723074595946

 there’s my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money 	18.40476999646425

 —what age is he 	43.03833841024932

 queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage 	12.377795642914078

 —why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny 	20.2558036447104

 he’d be about eighteen now way i figure it 	14.49412986474617

 the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor 	10.567698971118991

 —there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts 	14.197456689304174

 i must get a wash tomorrow or next day 	22.121637755349486

 i hate those buggers 	55.63867617673376

 suck your blood dry they does 	20.447111876539946

 seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <number> and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather 	19.135482225015895

 that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton 	15.098424395123088

 fellow the name of antonio done that 	23.724259265736336

 there he is himself a greek 	44.33335220887141

 —did it hurt much doing it 	28.437980237791404

 one asked the sailor 	58.04446920517605

 that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the 	11.420387282653627

 someway in his 	103.85981899355764

 squeezing or 	1033.0868363868542

 —see here he said showing antonio 	44.13201186630474

 there he is cursing the mate 	31.462044358441013

 and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn 	20.099312477479746

 and in point of fact the young man named antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin the goat who this time stretched over 	10.049925632788757

 —ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest 	21.410778670728302

 he’s gone too 	42.857417129885

 ate by sharks after 	32.49960307056499

 ay ay 	371.399387588288

 he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before 	19.208861225610292

 —neat bit of work one longshoreman said 	22.18800092525742

 —and what’s the number for 	36.009764395288954

 loafer number two queried 	66.83543517100114

 —eaten alive 	151.30605101876867

 a third asked the sailor 	36.22666567775463

 —ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number 	18.505259325399088

 a greek he was 	57.164935287134774

 and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end —as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio 	12.404637829431923

 the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill 	15.712011633117726

 mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink 	15.775016329854553

 his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs <initial> and begged the chance of his washing 	15.560200984021728

 also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing 	12.380989213340422

 still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with bewley and draper’s marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt 	13.470715046466118

 still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off 	15.79708882966354

 round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her 	12.618654050450784

 —the gunboat the keeper said 	27.25533873351984

 —it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least 	13.146508816434519

 unfortunate creature of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition 	23.08711726036909

 still no matter what the cause is from 	32.82486548505205

 stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking —in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade 	14.049903301159528

 fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul 	15.638248057512325

 she is a bad merchant 	84.80879224953402

 she buys dear and sells cheap 	24.14078191179923

 the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start 	12.86751270409125

 whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned 	12.663748844661743

 —you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul 	23.8912039242409

 or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup 	13.625717924836882

 i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter 	24.033970475819153

 otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance 	13.809052022152938

 do you 	77.22106385094781

 thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say —they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible 	15.73076641007209

 it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette 	11.337073938048519

 mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining —simple 	13.732531714608479

 i shouldn’t think that is the proper word 	41.964624093405554

 of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon 	12.745332696395852

 but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god 	17.607190396670052

 —o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence 	11.335360835860053

 on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed 	13.91073910853293

 —has been 	120.3283143282805

 the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief 	22.770969856495537

 i’m not so sure about that 	19.79918942524575

 that’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there 	15.109255561808698

 my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i needn’t tell you 	11.113176625582259

 can’t you drink that coffee by the way 	19.277574797139273

 let me stir it 	55.967796455597686

 and take a piece of that bun 	57.66901019463824

 it’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised 	31.755058634887384

 still no one can give what he hasn’t got 	32.75770157487513

 —couldn’t stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further 	18.491145817700446

 faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work 	13.479358088663856

 to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders 	9.688314736148119

 on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying 	14.811253124581945

 the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of 	15.737364894931703

 sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where 	15.065041048629444

 anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble’s vi cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved 	13.292140751162698

 —have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred 	28.029921500590845

 thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage 	16.710505529063102

 —still it’s solid food his good genius urged i’m a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual 	11.170696118538899

 you ought to eat more solid food 	23.400453143492225

 you would feel a different man 	30.257206612442832

 —liquids i can eat stephen said 	33.11756732210497

 but o oblige me by taking away that knife 	17.40793215074791

 i can’t look at the point of it 	30.319214881737715

 it reminds me of roman history 	30.9168141632951

 mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it 	10.087504718908713

 —our mutual friend’s stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce  	15.207902420874643

 do you think they are genuine 	55.35311509180985

 he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots 	12.608960500679245

 look at him 	78.89480251858868

 yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel 	14.034686969692796

 he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him 	17.30626463083133

 though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity 	9.729650470090801

 he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described 	11.641377884589543

 on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera 	7.287446023655899

 and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him 	12.035621559421038

 —mind you i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention he resumed 	22.323097421271683

 analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with 	21.48661437176934

 in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods 	10.19159140756576

 there’s an example again of simple souls 	21.083420506857113

 however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded 	10.48316941461295

 on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap 	11.096919093057444

 —spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as old nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen 	12.80617398183613

 it comes from the great heat climate generally 	38.43024310568842

 my wife is so to speak spanish half that is 	21.69857487859034

 point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically spain <initial> <initial> gibraltar 	14.100604545794386

 she has the spanish type 	63.79640213148188

 quite dark regular brunette black 	23.720239949443215

 i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character 	12.398673286373484

 that’s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian 	21.20503161243984

 —the temperaments at the door stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings 	13.574903496770673

 roberto ruba roba sua  	44.05070339260093

 —quite so mr bloom dittoed 	66.05806159715495

 —then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino 	10.364701606634203

 —it’s in the blood mr bloom acceded at once 	26.500457292864755

 all are washed in the blood of the sun 	30.622754401874072

 coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there 	16.676200951467564

 the splendid proportions of hips bosom 	19.642220883034746

 you simply don’t knock against those kind of women here 	20.659728592824738

 an exception here and there 	27.01598678854089

 handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what i’m talking about is the female form 	25.79735484002873

 besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty no matter what you say 	14.060414031524317

 rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see 	15.630009463970945

 interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing 	13.056346794154228

 shipahoy of course had his own say to say 	47.26786332691641

 he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him 	13.743402649125779

 so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt’s rock wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand 	13.986218689986094

 that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror 	12.269373068141942

 then someone said something about the case of the <initial> <initial> lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck 	14.079918175153445

 no aid was given 	51.584169963928815

 her master the mona ’s said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way 	15.677971363856543

 she had no water it appears in her hold 	28.939207670655726

 at this stage an incident happened 	20.566797335222432

 it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat 	13.027926514298834

 —let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze 	18.651550577720847

 he made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left 	19.762663738148575

 while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozzle to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise 	14.853759641387311

 the irrepressible bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved 	11.31120257600425

 some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank 	12.700554815736105

 a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled 	9.3209631915389

 slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <number> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of 	9.61842223175638

 and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver 	15.299716661036541

 he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality 	18.391283917711167

 all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing 	11.874847192626921

 a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin the only launch that year 	12.019583702314112

 right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called 	11.288099315171948

 what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that eh 	12.17192596832762

 ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day’s work captain john lever of the lever line 	15.019757238439983

 —am i right skipper 	55.751316721337766

 he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions 	28.035795557595236

 that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds 	13.838917451902638

 mr bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question 	15.053409712071186

 anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation cum potation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook —the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot’s wife’s arse 	13.33461183655955

 o johnny lever johnny lever o after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided 	10.19243169232698

 skin the goat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god’s earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein 	11.39872417245951

 their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact 	20.40066943915809

 you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco 	12.766978739396354

 where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon 	28.432098883075064

 but a day of reckoning he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes 	11.693110299263466

 there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history 	35.46818886302103

 the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed 	20.52696860428633

 the boers were the beginning of the end 	41.77472814458407

 brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland her achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles the greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot 	10.92444104058059

 his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland 	15.883047645432509

 ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons 	23.011258420236782

 silence all round marked the termination of his finale  	32.18803332176735

 the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed 	11.256400629506796

 —take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism 	13.589382807957655

 to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view 	12.947659807235166

 —who’s the best troops in the army 	36.83482993131264

 the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated 	14.814592554032625

 and the best admirals and generals we’ve got 	21.28708663616677

 tell me that 	117.44293008587435

 —the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial blemishes apart 	11.041656166262467

 —that’s right the old tarpaulin corroborated 	27.17734792517034

 the irish catholic peasant 	52.072588833037706

 he’s the backbone of our empire 	25.64012143479447

 you know jem mullins 	50.68424020143733

 while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it 	10.271932050943631

 then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows 	13.213300729467852

 from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite 	11.104487978233022

 it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart 	15.712311723081921

 another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact 	9.44184607538708

 and now why 	110.59234011625026

 so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game 	16.182207543701956

 and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn’t the other person at all he <initial> couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated 	12.537270937127968

 quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle 	12.887860251753112

 yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skin the goat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on 	11.645327713354483

 he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high 	18.866608808507532

 like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again 	10.801538061691065

 generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow 	21.254283278266904

 so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £ 	17.696434988299306

 <initial> <initial> in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on 	21.0614801878799

 then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender 	21.165303698414434

 he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively 	35.65421082729374

 so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i’m not 	18.37726933375584

 that was one for him 	50.727553717835015

 a soft answer turns away wrath 	23.326282973258003

 he hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw 	23.03805841256347

 am i not right 	63.361727320147374

 he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly 	15.551155355928534

 — ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing christus or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum carnem  	10.588443834533088

 —of course mr <initial> proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question 	21.4981622290004

 it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves 	10.818327152929207

 but with a little goodwill all round 	41.08407372652652

 it’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality 	11.649087654197846

 i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form 	11.88670305728481

 it never reaches anything or stops anything 	15.652548425014379

 a revolution must come on the due instalments plan 	26.15513478792362

 it’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak 	15.171506646790442

 —memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war stephen assented between skinner’s alley and ormond market 	10.408787854129724

 yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark that was overwhelmingly right 	15.941343739221061

 and the whole world was full of that sort of thing 	26.432702605652835

 —you just took the words out of my mouth he said 	36.157416895348426

 a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely 	11.496990904714266

 all those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop 	10.697624901152173

 —they accuse remarked he audibly 	22.61883912393724

 he turned away from the others who probably… and spoke nearer to so as the others… in case they… —jews he softly imparted in an aside in stephen’s ear are accused of ruining 	11.746702558668776

 not a vestige of truth in it i can safely say 	22.106016582151025

 history would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them 	9.412425136624266

 that’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man 	11.385159489056031

 at least that’s my idea for what it’s worth 	32.998758355355235

 ubi patria as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in alma mater vita bene  	10.645388703882858

 where you can live well the sense is if you work 	31.84862524067487

 over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general stephen stared at nothing in particular 	14.675256264282256

 he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to 	12.400295811237743

 then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said if you work 	24.36007902260047

 —count me out he managed to remark meaning work 	17.74254344423496

 the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem 	13.808499932703343

 observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together 	16.063892680593415

 —i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense 	20.547625247620324

 also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing 	23.710798882078684

 writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays 	27.877785383177628

 that’s work too 	38.84501983952701

 important work 	465.661320207332

 after all from the little i know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price 	18.71425473865224

 you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has 	16.612029022323146

 you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn 	28.932572749701333

 each is equally important 	40.945032911832186

 —you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short 	17.53427894802732

 —i would go a step farther mr bloom insinuated 	33.51200777747449

 —but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me 	15.372001041705742

 —what belongs queried mr bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension 	18.679550537238963

 excuse me 	302.1434291887605

 unfortunately i didn’t catch the latter portion 	33.03041507842594

 what was it you 	69.32663845240786

 stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding —we can’t change the country 	11.443255979883988

 let us change the subject 	37.99274533360266

 at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry 	14.580561285729585

 the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part 	20.741307252067365

 needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state 	16.845243607951847

 probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people 	15.516241281560731

 with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves 	11.067005691625136

 for instance there was the case of o’callaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact  	9.641107981194498

 and then the usual dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains 	10.948365313107841

 briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good mrs grundy as the law stands was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it 	12.225924941244825

 ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and every welltailored man must trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two she unbuttoned his and then he untied her mind the pin whereas savages in the cannibal islands say at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental 	9.894609906356706

 however reverting to the original there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps 	26.420227235756656

 sheer force of natural genius that 	28.20301937651022

 for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it 	13.90258248583493

 still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small 	6.987663006415527

 all the same bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years 	13.971518783207447

 highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly inadvisable all things considered 	17.01316918069881

 something evidently riled them in his death 	41.92517993132475

 either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands 	9.263885461748952

 of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility 	10.032087053791228

 it certainly pointed a moral the idol with feet of clay and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging 	12.503621390428279

 you had to come back 	67.63311974128564

 to show the understudy in the title rôle how to 	18.186511480200085

 he saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible or was it united ireland a privilege he keenly appreciated and in point of fact handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip what’s bred in the bone 	15.260715354455755

 still as regards return 	70.75165740285674

 you were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back 	15.110221054937861

 then a lot of shillyshally usually followed tom for and dick and harry against 	11.395009247538844

 and then number one you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case roger charles tichborne bella was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he the heir went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink lord bellew was it as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then when got up to tally with the description given introduce himself with excuse me my name is so and so or some such commonplace remark 	14.903228967018592

 a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first 	15.122986325046547

 —that bitch that english whore did for him the shebeen proprietor commented 	15.466229507099191

 she put the first nail in his coffin 	59.294790624613015

 —fine lump of a woman all the same the soi disant townclerk henry campbell remarked and plenty of her 	12.794403648563797

 —ay skin the goat amusingly added he was and a cottonball one 	20.105710030643166

 this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage  	14.144545396348974

 as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings 	13.905072225787253

 first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into 	11.318460816331083

 since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of 	11.514809810818415

 whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved one’s smiles 	15.683562688302988

 the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up 	23.055733535439025

 can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk 	15.82180125944827

 though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly 	14.961230804068139

 and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times 	17.132350420418557

 why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side 	15.400945314305778

 north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldn’t do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds 	11.360368438727015

 stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue 	12.27018085445182

 —mrs bloom my wife the prima donna madam marion tweedy bloom indicated 	14.442826418937742

 taken a few years since 	49.38588948012015

 in or about ninety six 	24.75234120102703

 very like her then 	74.99793997526683

 beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen 	13.161359626304126

 as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup 	20.17488031415683

 she could without difficulty he said have posed for the ensemble not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the 	14.460421825614945

 marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest 	27.638844463928734

 yes puritanisme it does though saint joseph’s sovereign thievery alors bandez figne toi trop 	9.75095325683544

 whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word 	23.871642909416092

 the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to 	13.677895564924153

 but it was scarcely professional etiquette so 	30.000118661146953

 though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm 	14.970682229573809

 and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion 	14.46655139677204

 nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint  	8.676980542333956

 in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out 	12.928850083507925

 suppose she was gone when he 	47.36599696124377

 i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray 	12.392371059927015

 the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated distingué and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would 	16.32186038977997

 besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter 	25.1866975991746

 and why not 	79.42825270793237

 an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business 	10.161370321419323

 how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate 	9.767702475926063

 then the decree nisi and the king’s proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it nisi was made absolute 	14.169346118902405

 but as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course 	14.52065145358171

 he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader’s who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader’s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o’brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals 	14.494012486452139

 though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive 	9.975925758923198

 as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character 	16.346847058004847

 his hat parnell’s a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave 	15.072165476971321

 on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others 	11.603787885773817

 he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt 	9.925240354703295

 it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime 	10.15424790094222

 in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs 	11.278043158909261

 to think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age 	12.239761715091356

 the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely humpty dumpty boiled 	10.232665356769735

 —at what o’clock did you dine 	35.83573885733751

 he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face 	20.217029531084176

 —some time yesterday stephen said 	28.031742374835968

 —yesterday exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday 	23.33330181757477

 ah you mean it’s after twelve —the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself 	22.684569215288445

 literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected 	20.511721433285487

 though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought 	12.201896202358983

 at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas 	9.392667575336574

 for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in people’s mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word 	9.301758060162133

 anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night 	20.147636860119576

 the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak 	11.299930175186537

 on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives 	21.421190564232678

 everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered 	25.45399121487297

 his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway 	18.67984749845716

 at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up 	12.543770495652437

 a move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids’ with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks passim  	9.742942736166718

 at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew 	14.40328592212426

 people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep 	19.16439920262999

 the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles 	18.02337760379803

 because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick on shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo 	14.17207135195773

 my diggings are quite close in the vicinity 	28.137684780424056

 you can’t drink that stuff 	31.10682344178151

 i’ll just pay this lot 	18.397559275113704

 the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to 	11.031773127664184

 —yes that’s the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less 	15.843828340477122

 all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his b’s busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck 	10.092850114746444

 an opening was all was wanted 	38.74408105769738

 because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to 	17.086413753978743

 the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in london somewhere 	15.083695019878947

 silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement 	24.598459840609006

 then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect 	14.664555456659246

 to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why 	14.56600023693742

 —give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience 	12.437817085441251

 —and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed 	14.813063631712055

 the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears 	16.719663391157336

 —are you bad in the eyes 	55.60262118039764

 —why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as i uses goggles reading 	14.101591141364652

 sand in the red sea done that 	41.229712594295904

 one time i could read a book in the dark manner of speaking 	35.28223011890267

 the arabian nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she 	16.370480077555236

 hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of king willow iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts during which time completely regardless of ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark 	8.385137540612927

 to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee 2d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark 	10.782449368118723

 —come he counselled to close the séance  	18.460396248981578

 seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente  	12.927400948084923

 stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door 	11.125151861814263

 —one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment 	39.18383014812094

 why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafés 	20.572578032165914

 so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles 	14.115423653464372

 the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins 	16.811874517018495

 —it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment 	30.63584313534984

 the only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man 	25.007855823999112

 it’s not far 	39.71806492510943

 lean on me 	126.10928239610452

 accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly 	27.044110891180086

 —yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that 	17.20339499182916

 anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc 	19.14535633935034

 where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new 	10.69228131827948

 and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings 	12.513753619867456

 wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of mercadante’s huguenots meyerbeer’s seven last words on the cross and mozart’s twelfth mass he simply revelled in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat 	15.345669673897294

 he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be  	12.563227146065904

 he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini’s stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or virtuosi rather 	11.260502195710139

 there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore 	17.299037948806305

 and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned par excellence lionel’s air in martha m’appari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephen’s respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat 	13.177055812279322

 stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare’s songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno ludendo hausi doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom <initial> did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd william who played the virginals he said in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull 	8.148857003611731

 on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull 	10.909846947661098

 he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence 	17.32794250313681

 by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other’s sleeve gently jocosely remarking —our lives are in peril tonight 	11.230324117655359

 beware of the steamroller 	277.5622927667387

 they thereupon stopped 	90.13984509512362

 bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts 	11.515484789792401

 but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up 	14.158178503313241

 he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world 	20.272072365366864

 but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernan’s of the same size would be a holy horror to face 	16.408315627579807

 nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees 	13.555062443383886

 whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye 	14.329057513409245

 these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old 	15.323975283619006

 —what’s this i was saying 	40.90599457620745

 ah yes my wife he intimated plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind 	11.466439066071269

 he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built 	17.850129660265562

 still supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall’s irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general 	15.803449980552932

 exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from 	8.225721686961718

 even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled bloom a bit von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten 	9.3998610860194

 these opening bars he sang and translated extempore  	15.253286556347527

 bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did 	21.39554422239488

 a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of <initial> <initial> a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you 	9.30386052505794

 it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on record—in fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have 	13.715233259205277

 added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees 	16.822195272533886

 once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny 	11.798060815075797

 it comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting 	12.514496106918953

 why similarly why differently 	56.726213053471184

 similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian  	17.173433178782627

 differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation 	32.81359844069817

 in other respects were their differences similar 	18.272094665782088

 in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness 	13.187970825583616

 for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation 	9.728149300231294

 why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter 	9.444627111009876

 what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions 	13.171290842696438

 the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert hengler’s circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clown’s papa 	12.568176459003826

 was the clown bloom’s son 	30.50662549320681

 had bloom’s coin returned 	46.449334676988784

 why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him 	15.379226019962033

 because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity 	8.043367019563668

 he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions 	11.618801301300142

 there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay 	5.758601713229185

 why did he desist from speculation 	29.242057445503722

 because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed 	18.670438728522004

 did stephen participate in his dejection 	51.237830085704225

 was this affirmation apprehended by bloom 	15.54992805643946

 not verbally 	455.57510378651995

 what comforted his misapprehension 	46.0472369878205

 that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void 	26.560037787414547

 in what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected 	14.512303270940697

 what did each do at the door of egress 	27.823524016303576

 bloom set the candlestick on the floor 	37.62115818917593

 stephen put the hat on his head 	49.07562587278632

 for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress 	24.70677520759049

 for a cat 	161.76584793748776

 what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden 	18.63189005556099

 the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit 	11.041666208795018

 with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations 	14.830133965351209

 meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis maior <number> lightyears <number> miles distant and in volume <number> times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <number> of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity 	7.499812038515985

 were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast 	10.188985530836224

 of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached 	6.616177037807815

 why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result 	18.402100277888145

 because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places <initial> <initial> the 9th power of the 9th power of <number> that the result having been obtained <number> closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers 	10.69608236154258

 did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution 	14.299293957068977

 of a different order of difficulty 	36.238404109205085

 conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <number> tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity 	6.925583595782235

 and the problem of possible redemption 	30.746597213805746

 the minor was proved by the major 	32.121356422545944

 which various features of the constellations were in turn considered 	31.082004406260342

 his bloom’s logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error 	14.160489880902071

 that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman 	23.02215284274315

 that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence 	9.70470176991698

 was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle 	32.907532546864346

 indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet 	15.58092537985136

 did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters 	9.392890277849332

 it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity 	7.682461090715884

 how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp 	11.264527160244016

 with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion 	5.3687114787538786

 both then were silent 	44.49969774989259

 silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces 	16.69316137776466

 were they indefinitely inactive 	45.328016872602795

 the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar bloom’s longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution <number> scholars stephen’s higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure 	10.555508749740348

 how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer 	17.410119667608754

 by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress 	8.908532975262078

 how did they take leave one of the other in separation 	32.69145364514283

 standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles 	12.711753062957188

 • <number> yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <number> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <number> / <number> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come <number> or <number> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <number> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die <number> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered <number> teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea <number> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give <number> points in <number> to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <number> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <number> big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <number> / <number> after <number> when i saw the <number> dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him <number> or <number> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <number> acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <number> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <number> / <number> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <number> / in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <number> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <number> years more i have of life up to <number> no im what am i at all ill be <number> in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she <number> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page <number> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <number> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <number> of the <number> wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into <number> of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that <number> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <number> with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about <number> minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over

i burned the half of those old freemans and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c i’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <number> rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest

he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <number> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the <number> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones

to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his

 mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <number> or a <number> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because <number> drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <number> times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in <number> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <number> years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about <number> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking

and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats that sunday morning with captain rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining i could see over to morocco almost the bay of tangier white and the atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <number> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the

his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago

all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <number> consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news <number> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <number> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <number> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what <number> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at <number> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her <number> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us <number> days every <number> or <number> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <number> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about <number> weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <number> and <number> times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <number> minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after <number> years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <number> sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait <number> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their <number> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <number> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <number> / in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats <number> years ago now yes hed be <number> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the <number> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <number> queens and the <number> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <number> red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait <number> i was married <number> milly is <number> yesterday <number> what age was he then at dillons <number> or <number> about <number> i suppose hes <number> or more im not too old for him if hes <number> or <number> i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in <number> / <number> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from <number> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <number> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <number> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <number> lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <number> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <number> 7s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <number> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <number> he can make it for <number> im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only <number> / <number> or <number> / <number> ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <number> or <number> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <number> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want £ <number> or perhaps <number> / ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent <number> or <number> questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today i mean no no fridays an unlucky day first i want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it i think while im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes i can accompany him first i must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll i wear shall i wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in liptons i love the smell of a rich big shop at <number> <number> /2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table id get that cheaper in wait wheres this i saw them not long ago i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <number> years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas <number> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes 	12.813186813879401
